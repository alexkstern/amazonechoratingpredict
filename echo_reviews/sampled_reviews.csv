I bought family members the Amazon Echo last year for Christmas gifts and have been jealous the entire time (and they all LOVE the Echos)!  This past Christmas, I was given an Amazon Dot and love it!  I didn't want the Echo because I have an awesome Bose bluetooth speaker, and I hooked my Dot up to!  Love playing my music and having Alexa control my home's lights, thermostat, etc.  Alexa's voice recognition blows Apple's Siri outta the water.  I've replaced Siri with Alexa, in my home! Love that new ""skills"" are added daily.07/20/17 UPDATE:  I knocked the review down to 3 stars now, the weather that Alexa reports is ALWAYS about 4-5 degrees warmer than it actually is.  It does not get the info from weather channel, as it shows the correct temperature for my zip code.  Yes, my Alex is setup for the same zip code as my weather app.  Get Alex weather app to report the correct current weather!!!",3.0

EDIT (4/26):  I wanted to provide more information as I interact with this device and compare the responses using Google (Assistant) on my android phone.  Recently, I asked Alexa how many pounds in 138 kilos,  she did NOT know it.  I then asked google and got a quick response. Today I asked Alexa, what is the planet after Uranus (it's Neptune btw) and at first she didn't understand me.  I asked it again very slowly, and she couldn't answer.  I asked Google Assistant and got an immediate response.  I find myself not really interacting with it except for very specific reasons and since I only spent 49 bucks for this device, I have been very forgiving of it.  If I had spent 179, this device would be a little better than a glorified weather, radio, and music delivery system.  Since amazon is pretty ubiquitous and the first to market this type of tech, it is doing well, but  lately I am finding it pretty underwhelming.PREVIOUS review..First let me say I absolutely love the idea of the Alexa products.  I purchased the Echo Dot with so much excitement and I couldn't wait to plug it in and start interacting with it.  I use it to set alarms, I use it to get the weather, play music, setup lists, and add calendar events.  The voice recognition is not perfect and I don't expect that.  I have used the voice training a couple of times and intend on doing it some more.Here's the reason for the 3 stars -- the connectivity is bad it's been dropping a lot recently.  When I first got it, it was fine.  Now, I have had to re-establish WiFi 2-3 times per day.  I do it before I leave for work and I come home and I have to do it. again.  That means I also have to have it  re-connect to my smart devices (I have a Phillips Hue).  It is a pain and this is the only device I have this issue with.  I have a Mac, a gaming PC, and a cellphone and none of them have a problem with my WiFi and I steam live TV!I suspect, though I can't be sure, that it might have something to do with going having to to through Amazon's WiFi and cloud network. Who knows and as a user, I DON'T care, I just want it to work and it doesn't work consistently!  I really don't want to use Google's assistant, but I'm seriously considering it.  I was going to purchase another Dot for the downstairs, but I am going to wait and see what happens.If I had purchased the Alexa for 180 bucks, I'd really be annoyed.UPDATE:  Things have been stable for a few days and I updated my rating.  I really do enjoy this device, it's not perfect, but I see many benefits in having one.  Ask Alexa ""What sounds do whales make""",3.0

We were also encouraged to accept a gift card rather than a refund.I think that that the white echo dots that were sold for $39.99 were somehow different than the black ones for $49.99. And why was it not made known before purchase that this product was incompatible with several popular modem brands, and which ones? EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.",1.0

LOOOOOOOVE my Dots! I'm really getting used to talking to Alexa, getting helpful information, turning off and on music, lights, etc.I have two desires in order to get to 5 stars:1) Alexa confuses profiles if two Amazon Household members each have separate Amazon Prime accounts. My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts. However, when registered in Alexa as a household, she can't tell one calendar from another. This makes no sense to me, since each registered email address has its own GMail calendar, but according to Amazon Support, Alexa can't distinguish them if we have separate Amazon accounts. The result is she can only read from one calendar, regardless of which profile she's set to. It's a minor annoyance, but makes the calendar connection useless unless we close one of our Amazon accounts.2) Alexa has a bit of trouble distinguishing Smart Home routines. For example, if you have 2 Smart Home routines called ""Enter Bedroom"" and ""Leave Bedroom"", she always has to ask which one you really want, even though ""Enter"" and ""Leave"" sound nothing alike. If you remove the word ""Bedroom"" from both routines, then she's fine, which would be an option if I only had one room in my house!",4.0

It's getting there. Perhaps in a couple years and a few generations it will really work well.Cons: BlueTooth is NOT a good protocol for music, Low bandwidth and muddy audio is very noticeable on HiFi systems. Only other audio output is the 3.5mm line. AirPlay or DNLA should be an option. With AirPlay you get quality audio to any AirPlay device or all (Whole House Audio).Home Automation: Doesn't work with Vera Mios HA controller. Vera is the most versatile for under $150 and supports the most devices unlike Wink, SmartThings or Insteon. If you want to use Echo with Vera you need the HA-Bridge server. You can run this server on a RaspberryPi. At least then you can control your lights. lock doors, control scenes etc...Thermostats: Adjusts temp on EcoBee and Nest. Can't read home temp or humidity. Alexa, what is Ecobee's room temp? Doesn't work. you can only adjust settings.Security systems: Basically non existent integration for quality systems like DSC. I have a DSC with internet access, remote control, and fully integrated into Vera HA. Only thing I can get Echo to do is Arm it through the HA-Bridge. Can't read any sensor status.Home Theater: It can control the FireTV some. That's a start. It can control JRiver media center. But only the music. Not XBMC or Plex. There are developers working on XBMC and Plex though. XBMC / Plex and AirPlay are my top two wish list items.Pros: It's entertaining. It can look up info for you. Play audio from various streaming services. Add to a shopping list, order things, It does work as described. Voice control is really good. We like it and for $50 it's a steal. Buy a  6 pack for Christmas gifts.Update: 12/7/2016 The best option for audio quality is using the stereo jack. I'm working on a way to take the line out into a USB sound card with ASIO drivers to allow connection to DNLA or Airplay speakers. I guess the only other option is to jack in the audio out to speakers in each room and link multiple Dots. that might be a better a cheaper option for Whole House audio.Update: 12/10/2016 You can't link all the Echo's to play the same thing at the same time. So, I came up with a solution for whole house quality audio over Wifi. Get a behringer UCA222 USB line-in adapter. Use the ASIO drivers. Connect the Echo Dot to the line. Download and install a utility called TuneBlade for Windows OS. TuneBlade can take the USB audio input and play it over Wifi to any and all AirPlay receivers with a low latency of only 500ms. It's also CD quality. You can then control TuneBlade from your IOS device for where to play and how loud. I'm sure you can do this with a Mac and you won't need TuneBlade since AirPlay is built in. Then subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited and you got voice controlled CD quality whole house over Wifi.",3.0

So, we have four Echo Dot's in our house. We generally like the devices and the services they offer, but there's one topic that isn't working correctly: Household account management.If you have multiple Amazon accounts sharing one person's Prime membership, yes, you will automatically have an account available on the Alexa service. But not all of the account options and features work correctly. For example, if you add your calendar to your Alexa account, and another household member does too, all Echos in the house will read EVERYONES calendars, regardless of which user is currently logged in to that Echo device. I actually got done with a very long support call with Alexa customer service, who seemed very confused. They seemed to indicate that switching accounts verbally SHOULD allow you to have access to that account's calendar integration ONLY, but for some reason everyone was perplexed why it doesnt. Alexa's systems team should take note.The reverse is true with Smartthings integration, and Groups. If I want to create a group ""All the things"" and have them turn off, every user in the household needs to create the group. This is kind of nice, because it means everyone can customize what they personally call a room or device. But the larger issue here is that the experience is inconsistent.It seems we keep discovering different points that we're fighting the software here and there, and largely because the Alexa software doesn't document correctly in its UI interface which features will work for you (your personal account), or everyone in the Household account (via sharing information between accounts.)These ARE very convenient devices. We actually like a lot about them. But we keep hitting our heads against Household account integration issues, which is something I expected Amazon to have ironed out by now.",2.0

Received my 2nd Gen Dots on Oct 20th while at work and had to wait all day to get home and set them up. I split a 6 pack with my dad and I already owned 2 others(The Original and the 1st Gen Dot) and couldn't wait to set my three 2nd Gen Dots up. I use the Alexa to control the lights and temperature at my house, as well as play music, ask questions, hear news/radio, and any of the apps that I can manage to remember the commands too(like ""trigger…"" from IFTTT).Set Up:Set up was easy since I had already setup an account when I setup the other two. After searching and finding the Dots, all I had to do was tell it which WiFi to connect to and rename it to the room/area I was going to put it at.Testing new Feature:After I set all of them up and but while I still had them all in the same room, I ran a test  to see how well the Echos' were at choosing which Echo was closest. Without fail every time that I said a command(from different locations), the closest echo was the only one that responded. All of the others indicated that they heard me, but then ignored me and let the closest one answer. In some tests I was only inches away from all of them and the one that heard me the clearest was the only one that responded.This is awesome! For any one that has had more then one Echo before this one, you know how annoying it was when you would say a command, like ""play music by so and so"" and every Echo would then start playing a random song from so and so. Before this update I had to change my Echo's summoning word so that they wouldn't always answer at the same time, which annoyed my wife and guests that could never remember which Echo was called ""Alexa"" and which one was just called ""Echo"" and for a while I had 3 and I had to call that one ""Amazon"". So now with this update, all of the Echo's (including the old ones) can now all have the same Summoning word of ""Alexa"", which is great now that I have 5 Echo's in the house now.With the coverage I now have in the house, I now no longer have any issues with Alexa hearing me. I have yet to connect any of them to external speakers, but I have never had an issue with that before. I will update this review if there are any issues or any questions any one has about it.The Look, the Feel, the Design, all while comparing it to the 1st gen:As for the look. That’s really up to you and your needs. I went with the white ones, mainly because I had 2 black ones already, but also I thought the white ones would fit better with my houses colour scheme. Which is more important to my wife, and now that they are here and setup, she agrees that I made the right choice.  The white ones fit in better and in some cases blended in with my house and can go unnoticed until needed.Comparing the 2nd Gen to the 1st Gens. They don’t feel as nice or as solid as the 1st Gen Dots, but then they do come $50 cheaper then that model and yet do everything just as well or better. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t feel like they are cheap, just that the 1st gen's where made heavier and with moving parts. I don’t have a problem with the buttons, but I did feel like the 1st Gen's volume control was nicer(for those that didn't get that model, it's volume control was the same as the Original Echo) Now I like that the 2nd gens are even more compact then the 1st Gens, and that they smoothed out a few of the edges.Conclusions:For my setup needs, I didn't need any more original Echo's, I just needed more locations to send commands to Alexa. That way we didn’t have to yell or walk to a room/area Alexa was in in order for it to turn lights on or change the temperature, or turn off music. The new Echo Dots(2nd Gen) were perfect for my needs.In conclusion, if you are new to Echo, Smart Home devices, or IOT, this is the model to go with. It packs a lot of function at a very good price point. If you are a Vet of the Echo life and want to expand or complete your Echo home setup, this model is great at a price you can be proud to tell your wife about.Tips and Tricks:I was able to cover my home without having to break the bank, and if you've got someone else interested like I did, you can split a 6 pack or 12 pack and get the discount without having to buy more then you need.3rd Party Add-OnI have purchased a battery pack that attaches to the base of the Dot and allows it to work for roughly 6hours without being plugged into the wall. Perfect for when I need to move from play to place or (as I have found useful) for quiet evenings in the front porch on the swing with the wife listening to an audio book. It also make it possible to set up the device to work through your phones internet and allow it to work virtually any place your phone works(like the Echo Tap, but voice only, no need to press a button). This was definitely a cool buy. My only gripe on the several models I looked at and the one I eventually bought was that I never felt like the battery was attached securely to the Dot. It hold up to some abuse, but if dropped it will most likely disconnect and take a few minutes to set back up. In all, though, if you've got an extra Dot, this was a great addition, and honestly, I like this setup more then I like the Echo Tap. The only draw between the two is battery life and speaker volume. The Dot can connect to an external Bluetooth or AUX speaker without any issues to allow it to connect to a louder speaker if sound or quality is your issue. You can also plug the Dot with the battery into power with a micro USB. That would allow the battery to stay charged or recharge if needed without stopping the jam…or audio book in my case.Model info: Evo - an intelligent Battery Base for Amazon Echo Dot 1st & 2nd Generation (""Alexa"" unlimited)https://amzn.com/B01L0XDHBOIf there is anything else you want to know or have questions about, please just let me know.

I have the Amazon Echo tall and wanted to stream music to a stereo. I have the Dot in a bedroom about 35 ft from the router. The Echo DOT is unusable in that bedroom. If I ask it a question or tell it to turn on a WEMO outlet very often it will stall out and then the ring will go red saying sorry I lost connection. Once I got it to try to stream music it will constantly stall playing music and give up trying. I also tried using the hard wire RCA connection to the sound system from Dot but it had a noticeable baseline hiss that made that option irritating. I did send it back for an exchange but they said they refurbished it and returned it to me. Whatever was fixed didn't help it work any better. I ended up getting a Bose Soundlink https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K6P08FA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it streams music from Amazon prime very well (not using the Amazon Echo or Dot but using a built in app). The sound from the Bose is INCREDIBLE. I can't use the voice command on it like the echo but at least it works where the dot failed badly. The Bose won't connect to the Amazon Echo tall like I had hoped either.The sound quality from the Bose was FAR better than Echo through Bluetooth. I used the RCA connectors from Bose and the optical connector. I could discern a noticeable bit of better headroom and stereo separation via the optical route but the RCA connection was excellent as well since it did not induce any hiss, squeal or noise like all the Bluetooth gadgets I have tried. Yes, the Bose is 149.00 verses the Dot 49.00 but if you want supreme quality sound from Amazon Prime music, PC, NAS on intranet or internet radio It is hard to imagine a better product than Bose. I am a big fan of Bose speakers but I can honestly say that did not influence this review. I was only interested in listening to streaming music and for now Bose is the OINLY solution. I also have a Denon HEOS to compare with the Bose. BOSE WINS hands down on that contest. I call the Denon HEOS the Denon P-OS. The Bose plays my music from my NAS far better than the Denon and its apps. I have the Synology Disk station ds415play. The Bose app found it and was able to play my music better than my sony receivers, sony blueray players, the ROKU media players and my Vizio smart TVs. I can switch to next track super fast through Bose and go back and forth between folders on the NAS faster than even the Synology DS Audio app. If you want to play your music from a NAS Bose does it the best of anything I have found. I offer all of this verbage about the Bose to help anyone else looking for a streaming solution.",2.0

Very disappointed. I had great expectations for this device, as i was going to base my whole home automation on several of these devices however the following issues forced my to return it:1. Horrible Mic pick up. This is suppose to be the strong point of this device. Audio recognition for several people in my household was horrible. At 10 feet it was non existent. in other words, Echo would not even respond. Even after several session of ""voice training"", it still was terrible.2. Home automation linking with other devices has alot of ""growing up"" to do. The application on echo as well as the various drivers are very immature. I had difficulty pairing up to Z wave devices even though i was using a smart things hub (which is whole another disaster ...). very frustrating and unrewarding experience.3. Constant drop outs. Echo would loose internet connection when no issues existed. Mysteriously, echo would periodically loose internet connection and have to either be manually re-booted and initialize on it one. Very annoying !4. Alexa would start talking on her own, un-commanded. seems that she would repeat the last flash news or last music she was performing before being told to stop. then within an hour or so she would start up on her own.Please note that i have a 50 MB Fiber optic Internet service and run dual routers with 2.4 and 5 Ghz coverage in my house.I really wanted to like this device and build up my home automation. Both where a disappointment ! It seems that this device was not ready fro prime time. I will be looking to see of Google Home or Apple Home will be any better.",1.0

I love the Echo and Echo Dot.  I have run into and issue that is totally frustrating.  I have a total of 14 Echo dots in my home.  I have 1 in each room, mostly to allow control of my smart home and spread out the wireless coverage to these devices.  This works fine.  Unfortunately, I discovered Amazon counts each Echo as a unique device towards my authorized devices for my Unlimited Amazon Music subscription, which means I can only have 4 of the Echos authorized since my other devices hold the other 6 spots.  This leaves me with 11 Echo devices through which I can not access my Amazon Music subscripiton.  My home consists of 2 people, with only myself ever using the music subscription.  This seems like a poor decision on Amazon's part.  Why would Amazon not authorize their own devices to not count toward these authorization limits?  Especially a non-mobile device like the Echo.  Amazon does so many things very well, but Amazon is really awful when it comes to supporting their very best customers.

What I like: it responds very much like our Echo, minus the high-quality speakers.What I do *not* like: the Echo and the Echo Dot's microphones come into conflict with each other.  I have our Echo in the kitchen, and our Echo Dot in our bedroom - which is on Another Floor.  On occasion - such as today - I will be standing *3 feet* from our Echo and ask it to start a timer because I'm cooking something.  No response from the Echo.  Then I hear, from my bedroom on ANOTHER FLOOR, information indicating that THAT dot has started a timer.This would be a mild annoyance if the two devices communicated between themselves.  But they don't.  Upshot: the kitchen Echo doesn't record the timer, while the bedroom one does, and so I need to go up to the bedroom to know whether the dish I'm cooking in the kitchen is done.No doubt this is a glitch.  But until it is fixed, it's a major one.*** UPDATE - 01/16/17***My wife and I use the dot to play white noise to our 3 month old infant.  Usually, it's great.  For some reason, however, recently, the dot has randomly begun playing music.  UPSHOT: our 3 month old is asleep, listening to the soothing sound of rain, and SUDDENLY there's some jackass bellowing about his lost love.  Baby wakes up, much love is (further) lost, and my wife and I end up shouting to the Dot to shut the f--- up.Worse: this happens in the middle of the night. We wake up, and there's music playing.  F-R-E-A-K-Y.  No clear reason why the music is playing....",2.0

She can not answer 80% of my questions and often doesn't understand what I am saying (English is my first language and I don't have any regional accent.)  One major issue is that she does not use Google, only Bing, which is among the worst search engines.  This in itself is almost a dealbreaker, but if she worked well with other apps, it might be okay.  Even with apps she is supposed to be connected to like iheartradio, I often have to ask her multiple times before she understands.  It is not really a time saver.

I also use it to connect to my LIFX lights and even then it had problems connecting to all of the lights and would only work with some of them, meaning that if I'm leaving the house and ask Alexa to turn off all of the lights, it turns off half of the lights and I still need to take out my phone and turn off the other half.

BIG disappointment & waste of $$. This was a disappointment. I'd spoken with a customer service rep for my Echo who'd explained how one dit could be connected to an Echo so they could share services, such as my Unlimited music subscription, thus saving me carrying ny Echo from room to room. He was explicit in saying only one dot per Echo could be connected this way, but after I purchased it this turns out to be wrong. Second, I hoped to use this to travel, but it would not connect to wifi at either my friends house, nor the hotels wifi, so it was dead weight the whole trip. As I'd packed everything in a single carryon backpack, which I carried around NYC between Amtrak and places I stayed, it was annoying using space for something that didn't work. Here, at home in a 1-bedroom apartment, having 2 devices --1 in bedroom, the other in main living area--frequently causes both to attempt to respond, cancelling each other out, so I often have to unplug one in the room not in use. Since my unlimited music subscription for the Echo is what I use more than anything else, and that won't carry to the Dot, and timers and reminders are also device specific, except for the alarm clock and weather, the Dot is pretty much a paperweight in the bedroom.

For the most part it is useful, but it takes a lot of thought to try and explain the need for this device. Almost everything it does is better off done with just your phone. The only thing I use it for now it weather in the morning. That is it. It also does a horribly job trying to use my Spotify from my phone when I dont want it to switch from playing on my phone. Incredibly frustrating. Also works VERY poorly if you have more than one person on an Amazon account and Spotify. There was clearly no design for more than one person to share it. I would rate this dot at 2/5 normally. I can see how some people might find it useful, but I don't see it. The processing and ""intelligence"" is just way below what it needs to be useful. I literally want to hurl it out the window sometimes when a simple ""continue playing my spotify playlist"" turns into switching to a random station, saying it can't continue until there is playback when I just had a second before, or straight up not working.Here is where is goes all the way down to 1. The new, terrible calling system. DON'T sign up for that. My Dot now continually blinks green (in my room where I sleep to make it even worse) saying I have a notification? I don't have any. So I tried to turn it off. You CAN'T. You have to call Amazon and talk to them. How is this not an easy setting in the App? Another comment, the Alexa App is horribly designed.

Warnings- You will need a smart phone or tablet in order to run the initial setup. Luckily, I had one, but this requirement is not obvious upon purchase. Also, it is important to note that Spotify will not work with the Amazon Echo line of products unless the user has a premium account subscription.Music- If you already have (or can afford) a premium Spotify subscription, then I would actually highly recommend a device from this Echo product line to have the power to play any popular song at the command of your voice. The Amazon Prime music offerings are much more limited than Spotify (1 million songs vs 30 million), but if you have Amazon Prime you could get a taste for a similar experience. Lacking the premium music subscriptions to either, I was only able listen to Pandora radio stations, but found that there wasn't a great advantage in having this voice control option to play radio stations alone and generally deferred to other devices where I could play individual songs on demand. I also found it strange that there was no voice command option to increase/decrease volume.Home integration- I played around with the idea of purchasing smart switches and light bulbs (and getting fancy with IFTTT) in order to create a smart home, but ultimately decided that it was going to be more trouble than it was really worth.Other Thoughts- When left sitting idle, there were a handful of times in the two days of use that the device falsely triggered (thinking it heard ""Alexa"") and tried to answer questions. My kids did have fun asking Alexa basic questions and requesting jokes but the responses were fairly limited and the novelty soon wore off. This was a gift. I returned it to Amazon.",2.0

We went through the script, resetting everything and finally, the customer rep escalated my case. When I got the next level rep, my dot had started its working correctly cycle, so we disconnected. No sooner had we ended the call did the dot stop working again. Called back to customer service and the first rep decided to begin the reading of the script. I put a stop to that foolishness right away and told him to immediately escalate the case. The new rep determined that it was indeed a failing dot and then informed me that the dot 2nd generation only had a 3-month warranty and I would need to pay another $50 for a replacement (1st generation had a 1-year warranty). I had spent 1.5 hrs total this afternoon with customer support reps to find out that this device has one of the crappiest warranties in electronics! I hit the roof. I told them they either replace this piece of junk that has their name on it, or they cancel my prime membership. Their call. There was no third option.

Understanding the speaker quality is poor compared to the full size echo as expected, I found this unit is prone to stalling when starting streaming audio or music, sometimes for minutes, while the full size echo is not.  Placing them side by side, even after shutting down the echo, proved this point when I contacted Amazon Support by phone.  My kindle also streams in the same location with no hesitation at all.But unlike the other items you purchase here on Amazon, this product cannot be directly returned or exchanged on line - instead, you are told to speak with a support engineer (try it and see!) - and after spending an entire Sunday afternoon speaking with three different support folks (all very friendly) , they finally agreed to open an engineering ticket.  The end result is another e-mail after two days, telling me to de-register the unit and try again - though we already did that twice when on the phone with poor results.Its altogether possible my unit is defective, but Amazon will not process a replacement even after this ""back and forth"", unless I call again and make the case to another engineer.  I was not initially looking for a refund, and was willing to buy the full size Echo (my third) on the spot if they would process a credit and accept the return - with no luck.This inability to process a return or exchange on-line as you can with all other products, coupled with the limited time warranty leads me to believe something is odd here, and I am disappointed Amazon has decided to carve out an exception for this item when it comes to handling customer concerns.UPDATE - Amazon support called again today to offer an exchange, and I do appreciate their follow-up.

If you plan on using the Dot to listen to music, assume you will need to connect to speakers or just buy a full sized Echo",3.0

The Echo Dot 2G was really nice for about a month for me, being filled with movie/game/misc references.However, that's it. Aside from that, it feels very limited.For music, Echo is very limited to people without a bluetooth MP3 player of some sort.All that's available is Amazon Music (with a limit of 250 songs I believe unless you buy premium of some sort), Spotify (if you purchased Spotify's premium), Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn Radio.Which sucks because if you're a person who's into remixes or silly songs, you can't access other platforms such as Soundcloud. Another thing is that if you're an artist of some sort, you need to say ""Alexa, pause/play"" before Echo completely stops itself while playing music every hour or so.Another thing is that it has to stay plugged into the wall. There is no battery available for the Echo unless you want to buy a 3rd party battery add-on.Finally, Alexa won't answer with anything google question-related. You'll always have to use Wikipedia as your source of information.",3.0

Amazon should have thought long and hard before engaging such underperforming and ""glitchy"" partners.  Neither of these programs work and support is non-existent.

You can't ask her questions that she needs to Google/look up answers to, hopefully they remedy that soon (ex: a friend asked ""who is the founder of miller lite beer""). This is really a bummer because Google assistant can help with that and more, no problem. There are things that I do LOVE about Alexa! Having my Amazon music readily playable, hearing the news and the weather, tuning in to a radio station. She hears and recognizes voice fairly well. While playing ""Categories"", one of her skills, she had a hard time recognizing some of my spoken words as correct answers because she misheard me. I love the lights, very futuristic to ""point out"" where you are speaking from. She's pretty loud. I like that purchasing can be disabled. I think some of her enabled game skills will be fun for family game night or even beers with friends.

Ended up getting this for a great price on Prime Day.  This is great for someone who (1) already has speakers in the home with aux-in and/or bluetooth, (2) enjoys Amazon Music, and (3) enjoys shopping on Amazon.  I was able to integrate this with Google Calendar which was surprising but nice.  While it was always fairly easy to hook up my phone to existing speakers to play music, the Echo Dot just makes it so much easier--just speak a few key words, and the music plays.  While Alexa can do many things, I wouldn't look at this as a fully functional Google Search device (the Google Home speaker is probably more ideal for that -- although it comes at a premium).  Besides playing music and adding events to my calendar, there have been other very basic features that have come in handy: setting a timer, setting a reminder, asking for my weather forecast, adding items to my shopping cart, and reading me my notifications (i.e. your Amazon order has shipped!).  Overall -- no regrets, great purchase, and great gift idea for any fan of Amazon Prime that otherwise doesn't need anything else.",4.0

I have one of the original Echoes -- bought it sight unseen when Amazon offered it to a few Prime customers for $99. I'd never give it up.

It's a less costly version of the Echo.CONS: There's no ring on the top you can turn to control volume like on the Echo -- I really love that Echo feature. But the buttons you get instead aren't bad.Some find this product confusing. It does exactly what the Echo does for less. It has its own speaker, but not as big or good as the Echo's.

Ok so I got this because I am a techie and thought this would be neat to have. I thought it would be fun to control my lights by voice (I got Philips Hue lights to go with it) and maybe ask it some questions but the Echo dot and Alexa have proven much more useful than I ever expected. I originally got one of these for my bedroom, which is where my only smart lights are, but quickly ordered another for my bathroom to use while I get ready in the mornings after trying my first one out there. So now I have one in my bedroom to control the lights and play some music and one in the bathroom to get the news and weather info when I am starting my day. One common complaint I often read was of how bad the speaker was on the Dot. However I think it is great, given the size of the device. No this isn't the speaker to use at a party, and yes the music sounds just good to ok, but for the small size of the Dot and still considering it costs $50, I think the included speaker is more than adequate. It is easily more than twice as loud as my phone speaker.Cons: I would have to say my biggest gripe with the Dot itself is that sometimes it doesn't understand what I said. However, in every instance in which this has happened I have either been facing almost directly away from the device or had music playing at a loud volume and the Dot didn't hear the wakeup word. My only wish for a change to be made to the device that I would like to see in a 3rd generation would be a ""shut-up"" button. Just some sort of button so I dont have to shout ""Alexa stop"" when she is reading something long.The biggest con I feel overall is with the Alexa app, especially its skills app store within the app. The companion app is somewhat slow and not the most intuitive/well planned out. However it does get the job done.Alexa software: I feel like Alexa is pretty good AI software. I would say not as good as Google now on my phone though. Her responses to questions could be more concise and the voice could really be changed to something more human sounding, although it is not awful.So, after all of these negatives, why 5 stars? I give this 5 stars because I feel the device/hardware is worth 5 stars, especially when you consider this is a very inexpensive way to enter the home automation market. I do feel the software needs some improvements, and fully know that it will continue to improve as time goes on.

The Echo Dot is a great device, but as an original Echo owner I have to knock it down a star. I love that Dot can practically be dropped anywhere in a room due to its size (and for the price it's affordable to do so), and that it doesn't have a power light anywhere on it so it's perfect for a bedroom (the original has a white power light on the back of it; practically unnoticeable but in a dark room...). Both devices use the same Alexa voice service, so they both excel at the same areas and have the same limitations and quirks. However, I pre-ordered a six pack of Dots and the two I've opened so far have the same issues - even after running voice training four times on each device.First, the original Echo seems to wake and listen much more effectively than Dot. I moved my original Echo from the bedroom to the kitchen and put a Dot near my bed. Dot will often misunderstand me, even with statements that original was astoundingly good at. For example, ""Alexa, turn off the tall living room lamp,"" with original would be correct every time, while Dot will sometimes misinterpret ""off"" for ""on"". A lot of times it won't wake at all where the original Echo would.Second, the audio quality and volume just doesn't seem to be there. I understand this thing is smaller than an alarm clock so, really, what should I expect, but at 75% volume it's equivalent to my phone at 50%.Third, there seems to be some incompatibility with certain skills. My favorite is the Jeopardy game and I play it daily. With the original Echo, each time was like being on a TV commercial for the device. With Dot, however, it usually asks the first question and immediately tells me I'm wrong. I've found if I answer very quickly she will sometimes accept my answer, but even then the performance is oddly slow. Original Echo was so fast it would be nearly conversational, even when interpreting words like ""croissant"" during the game, but with Dot the light ring will disco for several excruciating seconds before either telling me I'm wrong (and then reading out the answer I had just stated) or that she's having trouble connecting to Jeopardy.Lastly, I like to have the ""start"" and ""end"" sounds turned on so that I can just start talking to Alexa and not have to look at the light ring to ensure she's listening. Basically this means that the device will make a small tone when it's actively listening, and another when it's stopped listening. On the original Echo this works perfectly well, but the Dot, after some research, I've discovered will typically hear its own ""start"" tone while it's trying to listen to me. Since she can't hear me over the tone for the first bit of the recording, she can't figure out what I'm talking about and cause whatever command I've issued to fail. Compared to original Echo, this might be because the speakers on Dot are so much closer to the microphone, or because it uses a higher-pitched and longer tone for ""start"".I wouldn't say that people should avoid buying this as I'm sure Amazon will correct for these flaws over time with software updates, but for the moment, if you want the most solid Echo experience, go with the original.",3.0

This Alexa enabled Echo Dot  took a lot of thinking on our part as if it was useful for our home.  It has been a interesting process. You basically have to learn to use it.  You have to read the tips and tricks on the internet to find useable functions it has.  It comes with almost no directions.When you have a question it says to refer to the app on your phone.  The app doesn't do a good job of helping either.  I would prefer a computer app vs a mobile app.  You have to add ""skills""( I would call these apps in your head. You are asking Alexa on your app to add the skill to your Alexa.  Then it can complete the operation. Just like adding a app to your phone) to the app to make Alexa do special things other than place music.  BTW the sound comes from the bottom of the dot and it's quality is comparable to that of your standard home laptop.The Alexa skips the first syllable of every word.  It makes it difficult to understand it.  I bought another one and the same skipping is happening.  They say there are over 15,000 skill as of the Summer of 2017.  They are very difficult to navigate.  Some are specific to people, areas, groups.  Some are redundant.  The same type of skills.  The descriptions are limited and gives barely any instruction on how to use the skill.For playing you music any time, it has been fantastic.Bottom line is if you have the time the Echo Dot is certainly entertaining and new and exciting.",3.0

I think if I could find a suitable speaker to pair it with, I may like it more.

At present, I can only add things to a ""to-do"" or ""shopping"" list. Both of which require downloading a third-party app to sync on my phone. I would like the ability to create other lists.

When I got the Dot up and running, I thought, okay, it's not good but I could live with it. A couple of hours later I realized I couldn't. There was no reason to settle for tin-can-like sound. Also bad is the way the sound comes out: it's best (which is not good) if you have the cord side facing out. That makes it kinda ugly sitting on a shelf. The more I thought about it, the more convinced I became that this product is below Amazon's usual standards -- so I wondered if maybe I got a faulty Dot. I returned it, but didn't want to take a chance on swapping it out for another Dot. Rather, I opted to get the full-size Echo. I already have one and know how superior it is to the Dot that was delivered to me.I do see that many have given the Dot 4 or 5 stars, so that makes me think I may well have received a faulty one. Maybe some of those glowing reviews are from people who attach a speaker, but for me the Dot's selling point was how small it is.

When you get to the page in the Alexa app where you have to enter the network name and password, there is a link to ""advanced settings"" where you can enter the IP address and associated network information (gateway address, subnet mask, DNS servers etc) manually. These details will vary depending on your individual setup, and may require additional settings to be added or modified on your router, so if you don't know what you're doing, find a friend who does.

The Echo Dot is my first foray into the interesting world of the Internet of Things. I bought my first before Christmas because I was curious about their usefulness. I liked it so much I bought myself anopther one for my bedroom and a thrid that I gave to my brother on Christmas. Currently, I use my Dots to control my LIFX WIFI Color 1000 LED bulbs (which are awesome, btw), my large home stereo system and a smaller clock radio in my bedroom. I like walking into a room and saying ""Alexa, turn on the living room lights to 50%"" and ""Alexa, play relaxing music"". It makes me feel very Star Trek-ish. :) If you are subscribed to a streaming music service like Spotify, Pandora, Tune In, etc. then you have access to literally millions and millions of songs, live radio stations and podcasts that you can listen to by just telling Alexa to play whatever you want. It's so cool.Alexa can do lots of different things by simply enabling any of the tons of skills you'll find on Amazon. The technology isn't perfect just yet, though. While Alexa can hear and understand me pretty well across the room, she can get confused if the music or TV is too loud when you giver her a command. Normally talking louder will do the trick though. While there are a bazillion skills you can enable for free for Alexa, some of the need to be said in a certain way to get Alexa to do what you want. Aside from those two minor gripes, I am definitely enjoying my two Dots, especially for the forty bucks shipped I paid for them. :)",4.0

I've had an Echo for years now and love it, so thought I'd purchase the Echo Dot to replace the old clunky alarm clock on my nightstand with a slick little voice activated alarm that could also double as a sound machine at night (love the Babbling Brook skill!)Everything worked just fine for the first 2-3 weeks and then one day, out of the blue, the Echo Dot stopped recognizing the 'Snooze' command.  When the alarm goes off in the mornings and I tell Echo to ""snooze"", I know it hears me because the alarm pauses and the light ring changes color.... but then the alarm continues.

Doesn't matter how many times I try it or even if I yell, it never responds.... and let's face it, if you have to yell at it, then you may as well get up anyway because at that point you're already awake.Everything else works fine with it that I've tried, but unfortunately the lack of a workable snooze function will probably relegate me back to a clunky alarm clock... it may be clunky, but at least the snooze works.",3.0

This is a great entry level echo. Personally I like the regular echo better for certain reasons, but other people may have the exact opposite thoughts so read on. Note I bought a portable battery for my regular echo so it is fully portable so keep that in mind while reading this. The battery cost about ~$50 so add that to the $179 of the regular echo.Pros:- The Dot is awesome at $49. A steal.- You can use your own Bluetooth speaker. I have a Bose Mini Soundlink and it sounds great.- Does everything the $179 echo can, with the exception of sound good, at a fraction of the price.Cons:- Internal speaker is poor. If you want it for music you need a good Bluetooth speaker = more cost.- The mic seems less sensitive than regular echo. No science to back this up, just my impression. I feel like I repeat myself more with the Dot.- When I have a Bluetooth speaker connected, if I say ""stop music"" it stops. Then I turn my speaker off.  The Dot starts playing again?  I have to turn the speaker off, wait a second for the audio to kick in on the dot, then tell dot to stop music.  Both ways should work, shouldn't they?- Less immersive sound than regular Echo. The Bose Mini is directional.  If you are in front of the speaker it sounds great. Move to the sides and it looses some umph. While the regular Echo speaker doesn't sound as good as the Bose in optimal settings, because the regular Echo projects sound from all around it tends to fill a room better (while working in a garage or taking a shower for example)Both are great deals, Dot is cool, just some differences to keep in mind and get what best meets your needs.UPDATE:OK with the Bluetooth speaker and stopping music issue I reference above, these are the steps I have to take to stop playing music and disconnect the speaker:1. Say ""Echo, disconnect my speaker"". (Note sometimes she gets confused and thinks I want to connect another speaker so I have to do this twice)2. Once the speaker disconnects and music is now coming from Dot speaker, I say ""Echo, stop music""Again, if I stop the music then disconnect the speaker, Dot just starts playing music again.Update 2: I moved my larger echo to the bedroom and put the Dot where larger echo used to be in the kitchen. A couple times per day I would get a ""sorry your Dot has lost connection"" messages from it while interacting with it. At first I thought it was defective, but I ended up moving it about 20 feet closer to the wifi router. Problem is now gone. Thus the range on the Dot is not as good as the regular echo.",4.0

This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up"" a lot.In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the ""OK Google"" function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:1. When was the piano invented?2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back.",2.0

Compared to my ""large"" alexa, I've had nothing but problems with the Echo. To the degree that it's remaining unplugged most of the time. The microphone is weak and has a hard time picking anything up you say, and the USB connection seems to delay the Echo from starting playback. I'll attempt to play music or audio books and it may take 10-15 seconds for the book/track to start if they even do. That's of course assuming my request was understood initially.  I sit about 1 foot from it in my office. The AP is 10 foot from it, with full signal all over. And yet, I get the red line saying ""no connection"" and no reaction when spoken to. And don't rename your ""alexa"" wakeup word to Echo - that really made it into a big machine of rude ignoring anything you say.I also realized that having to yell ""Alexa, Stop"" every time my phone rings is not going to work out. That was my purpose/idea - instead of using my phone to stream background music or books while working, I wanted the Echo to do that. Plus I could add things to my to-do lists, shopping lists etc. when I thought of it in my office. I've been able to do none of that.  After switching back to my phone for music/audio to the Bose speaker, things returned to a non-stressed and non-yelling environment.

I got this as part of a bundle deal with the Harmony remote. At first, it was pretty cool. I'm not like a seasoned user of the echo though. I didn't even know if I had a use for it, and forced myself to try to use it until it just became a habit. I had it paired up with the Harmony hub. It can only do basic things like turn on/off things and that's about it. Yes you can change channels with it, but you can't do something as simple as like pausing and stuff like that which would have been way more useful for me than changing the channels. When it works, it works great. I don't have any problems with it at it's best. But there were a couple of seething issues that they need to address, and one minor one.First, the wifi connection. This thing keeps losing connection somehow. Mines placed like 8ft away from the router and it constantly loses connection.  I have no idea how. So you have to go through the setup again. The setup sucks too, because you can't even update the Wi-Fi on the Alexa app. It always shows a blank screen. So you gotta go on your laptop to alexa.amazon.com and do it that way. At first, it dropped the connection like once every like 4 days. then it just started doing it all the time. I used to just disconnect the power and reconnect it and it would pick it up on it's own. But after awhile, that doesn't do anything. In the time that it takes to setup, I would have been finished with that I wanted it to do already. Oh yeah, the other thing about losing the Wi-Fi with the Harmony hub. You have to tell it to rediscover the devices which take like 5 mins so that it can control the hub. That's the main thing that made me fed up and I returned it.Second, the microphone issue. As with everyone, it sucks. At first, it works really well picking up like 99% of what I say. Then slowly it picks up less and less. I think I was at like 40% by the time I decided to return it. I don't know what's wrong with it. I already did the voice training and everything and the first couple of days that thing was like spot on. Couple that with the Wi-Fi disconnect, it's like first it doesn't hear you, then when it does, it's like well too bad, I'm not connected to the internet to do anything. WTF, useless.The other minor thing is the Alexa app. You can't even set up the Wi-Fi the first time because it just does the blank screen thing. If I didn't go online and search for a workaround. I would have just returned it right away. Fix your app Amazon. The only reason why I consider it minor is because you could do the setup still with your laptop.Also with the 3.5mm jack. I haven't seen anyone post this issue, but on mines. Whenever I turn off the speaker that it's connected to without taking the cable out, it stills try to send audio to it as if it were still on. So hooking it up to my amp was pointless because when the amp is off, you can't hear Alexa. I'm not going to leave it on all the time. This happens with like portable speakers and stuff too. I'm not about to disconnect the cable every time. I ended up just using alexa to turn on my amp through the Harmony hub to play music instead.All in all, it's an okay device. I would pick it up again if they could iron out those issues. I feel like the it's like kind of software glitch or something that is going since it works really well in the beginning and then it slows down over time and these issues crop up. It is constantly uploading data though from what I could see on my router. I don't know what it's uploading though.",3.0

I'm sure this is a great product it just didn't do what I thought it would be like answer questions instead it just kept telling me I don't know I don't know. I had it for about 2 weeks it drove me nuts. So I sent it back. I'm sure if you have Bluetooth lighting and all that other stuff it would be a great product but really let's be honest you could just use a motion light to walk into every room of your house instead of buying this thing. And who's to say that once it's connected to the internet how secure is it really anyone with any voice can walk in and talk to it and ask it questions have it open your garage door have it turn on lights have it activate anything in your house that you have it connected to. What type of security does this thing really have and I'm not at all sure that it doesn't send information back to Amazon or whoever,1.0

At times it's DEAF...I have to scream at it and it still does not recognize what I'm trying to say (mind you, I don't have an accent and grew up here in the US).

I could not download the app outside of the US according to Google Play. After doing some research I was however finally able to download through Amazon Underground. Happy that I finally got the app and completed the setup, I explored and realised how useless this is outside of the US. I was a broken cookie. Or example with news and weather briefing, it only gives information for the US. I found no way for it to give news flash briefing for my country. Also with Tuning Radio, local radio stations that exists there cannot be found by Alexa. I began to get frustrated and angry.  Some of the basic features worked but are only useful if you re in the US. I am way disappointed and just wish I can get my money back.

After a couple of months with Alexa, I figure I'd share my thoughts.I wasn't so sure if I would even use the Dot, but I do. Especially in the mornings, when time is at a premium.

Hilariously, she has no issue recognizing my voice, but not so for my wife, who has to scream at Alexa for some reason.Alexa's skill set is impressive, but I do wish there were some basic things she could do better. The timer/reminder functions are lacking and oversimple. I should be able to add things to a to do list, or remove them, without correcting them on my phone. I should also be able to assign reminders to those items, but so far, this seems a little complicated.I am really holding out for Sonos integration.

You can open a new account and purchase all your music again was what they said. It is also very difficult to figure out what music you can play.

It sometimes will start to answer a question and then stop half way through.

Making basic cursory searches is something I  do multiple times a day, and it was something I was looking forward to using the Dot for, but unfortunately the Dot just can't do it.The dot will also sometimes trigger itself from words on TV or even in nearly complete silence, another thing I expect to improve over time as the voice recognition gets better.My recommendation: Buy it, but not yet.

I congratulate you on convincing me to pay $49.95 for the privilege of purchasing a miniature version of my husband.Seriously though, this thing has such potential. Unfortunately, to get useful answers to many things you have to load skills and you have to ask Alexa to use the correct skill. Who wants to constantly look up and remember the name of skills? Just make the darn thing work.  As others have noted, answers are only correct about 25 percent of the time and even basic questions sometimes result in encyclopedia length answers for what should be a quick response (Example: What is the humidity today? Instead of a simple answer, you receive a looooong scientific response. )  We use it only for music and timers.

I was one of the first people to buy the full sized Echo.  And now I have just bought a Dot.The max volume on the Dot is about 1/100th the volume of the full sized Echo.  Imagine if you connected some earbuds to your cell phone and laid them on a table, and then played a song at max volume on your phone.  The sound level coming out of the earbuds on a table is about the sound level of the Dot at full volume.You actually get more volume if you turn the Dot upside down, but that means you are covering up the microphone and the controls.This means you will have to buy a speaker to go with the Dot.  If you buy a speaker to go with it, then you have just spent more than you would have if you bought the full-sized Echo.  So it makes no sense to buy the Dot,The Dot is capable of linking to a bluetooth speaker. If you get a bluetooth speaker which is comparable to the sound of the full sized Echo, the combined cost of the Dot and your bluetooth speaker will catapult right past the cost of a full sized Echo.The Dot also has an audio output jack on it which allows you to connect a cheaper hardwired speaker to the Dot.  Even then, you are spending about the same amount on the Dot/speaker combination as a full sized Echo costs.It is also simply amazing it has not occurred to the makers of the Echo and the Dot to enable them to act as an intercom system.  They would double their sales, as any parent would tell you.  A Dot in every kid's bedroom and playroom.Amazon has this tendency to make one really good niche product, and then to make a totally subpar product for the same niche market.  Think Fire TV (excellent) and then Fire TV Stick (horrible).  They have done the same thing with the Echo and the Dot.Spend the few extra bucks on the full sized Echo.  You will regret it if you buy the Dot.",1.0

Having owned the original Amazon echo (which I left with my mother at her house), I wanted to try the echo dot for myself. The original echo has an amazing sound quality whereas the dot does not. The sound is very mono, it actually sounds like a cheap speaker from the flea market, and the speaker does not get very loud, despite the volume being at full blast and my phone being at full blast.  Mind you, I don't like my music loud enough so my neighbors can hear it, but I'd like to hear it over my shower head and I can't. Installation was easy, connecting it to the Wi-Fi was easy, overall the app configuration was easy to learn. Despite this being a convenient hands free system, it lacks a lot of the essential qualities of a well-sounding mobile speaker I could have gotten for $20, maybe $30. I also don't like that the unit (like the first generation) is entirely dependent on being plugged in. There's no battery for these units and it shuts off and restarts every time I move it around my apartment from the bathroom/bedroom to the kitchen so I can have music while I cook. I'd keep it in the bedroom and let the music play except I can't hear it from the kitchen. I don't think i would make this purchase again but I'm stuck with it until the next generation comes out with a better sound quality. I wish Amazon had a way to test out these speakers before buying.

Pretty disappointing overall. I mostly wanted to use it to play and change music on Spotify while I'm painting and my hands are dirty but when I tell it to ""Play music by Rezz on Spotify"" it will start playing something else completely random (country music) and even when I ask it to play specific playlists it won't understand and will play other music on Amazon music. I wish I could disconnect Amazon music completely. I also use it to connect to my LIFX lights and even then it had problems connecting to all of the lights and would only work with some of them, meaning that if I'm leaving the house and ask Alexa to turn off all of the lights, it turns off half of the lights and I still need to take out my phone and turn off the other half. So even though I got it on Prime Day for $35 I still feel it was mostly a waste of money. I'm going to keep it and still use it to play music when I'm painting but I'm still pretty disappointed and probably should've gone with Google Chromecast Audio.

I haven't been this excited about a tech gadget in awhile. I had high expectations for this gadget and that is what it's delivered and then some. At home I don't have a real assistant and my son refuses to read a book to me or set my alarm or turn on my Spotify so I've adopted Alexa:) It's a pretty great device, it does all that is stated in advertising and much more. I have been able to listen to audio books, command a playlist to open on spotify to play instantly with the ability to control the volume on command. I have set it to brief me on current events and news, I use it daily to set morning wake alarms and timers when I'm cooking and I can ask for cooking recipes and cocktail recipes. It will give me the game times and scores for my favorite teams, it tells me what traffic is like before I head to work, and just for fun I have connected it with my Firestick and it can pause when I need to take a break and resume when I return. And last but not least I currently own only one type of smart home device which is the TP-Link plug which I've connected to a lamp and it's just awesome to have the ability to turn a light on by voice command when I enter a room and before I go to bed. Very cool technology, I highly recommend this awesome little gadget. P.S. for the reviewers who hate it you probably need help setting it up. And I've helped set up 10 Echo Dots now and when it doesn't connect to the internet you either need to reset and start over or there is a problem with your internet. For the guy who said it doesn't turn on his tv, the description doesn't claim that the dot has that capability but the harmony hub should help:)",5.0

This product might be cool except for the fact I have had it several months and unable to use it due to the app never allowing me to connect to it. I have bought another phone, gone through several tutorials and even tried connecting through my desktop. The app is VERRY poorly done, and extremely non-intuitive. There are several steps that a youtube tutorial had explained that you would never had guessed, or was totally unexplained by just following the steps on the alexa app. This product is absolute junk for me in my case. A waste of money and complete disappointment. However I know several people whos app works fine, and another person who said they had crazy trouble as well. I'm don't believe I will be trying any kind of amazon exclusive items for a while. At least until they are technically savvy with their product.

I bought 3 echos and 7 echo dots. Most of them were Christmas presents but I kept one of the Echos and 2 of the echo dots.  I gave one of the echo dots to my boss who sits 20 feet from my desk.  We shared the same router and have the same company-issued iphone.  The dot I gave her kept going offline.  I took the dot I had from my phone and plugged it on her desk and set it up.  It worked perfectly, never went offline once.  I took the ""defective"" dot home to check and it was having the same issue of intermittently going offline.  I called customer service and informed the rep all the troubleshooting that I did and tried to request for an exchange or a replacement and the rep said he would transfer me to tech support because he can't process a replacement.  Why he got the call after I clicked ""REPLACEMENT"" from the options, I don't know.  After being on hold for a long time, the rep told me that Tech support has a long queue and was told to tell me to call my internet provider.  If I'm having internet issues, the two other echo dots wouldn't work as well.  The rep sounded embarrassed because he understood what I was saying.  Amazon needs to look at their EXCHANGE workflow/process and evaluate their troubleshooting process.  LISTEN TO WHAT THE CUSTOMER IS SAYING instead of going off a script and asking questions that waste everybody's time.  If I'm calling to ask for help troubleshoot a product, then transfer me to a tech support.  If I'm asking to get a replacement for a defective item, just send me a new one and get the defective item back.  It seems returning an item and clicking ""I don't want it anymore"" is a faster route.  Get a refund then buy the same item.  II AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.

The Echo is a fantastic product.  We've had one in the house for nine months and it has been an absolute gem.  We got the Dot for another room in the house, and it is significantly inferior.  It's not simply a question of the sound-- the responsiveness, the accuracy, the sluggishness in connecting to bluetooth speakers, the chopping off of the first second of a response as the thing communicates with whichever speakers you designate, all contribute to the drastic decline in quality between the Echo and the Dot.  And, while it does seem like Amazon really is trying with these products, it is very easy to come across a technical issue or a quality issue that is utterly beyond what customer service is capable of addressing.  They'll get on the phone with you, but whether they're capable of understanding or fixing problems seems seriously in doubt.",2.0

Overall we're impressed. The main reason I got it was to attach it to my existing stereo in order to stream music on zone 2 for my patio/bedroom/bath. I was just about to buy a Sonos Connect to do this (for over $300) but decided to try the Echo Dot first. I am so glad I did. The Echo does does a great job for this task - it connects to my stereo well and what's great is that Echo uses WIFI not bluetooth so the range to connect to it from your phone is much bigger. We can be on the opposite side of the house and use the phone to control Alexa and change the music.Tip: I used an existing audio cable to attach to Echo Dot so you do not necessarily need to buy the extra audio cable if you already have one.Tip: once you use voice control to activate Alexa to play music the first time, then you no longer need to keep using your voice to play music. You can just use the app on your phone and be in a different room. This is great. We can relax in the bedroom controlling Alexa while the Echo is in the living room.The only thing I don't like is that there are minimal/almost no physical controls and the app is sometimes slow to use to control Alexa.",4.0

The good:From a technology standpoint, this product is amazing, particularly the speaker array that never seems to have trouble picking up the ""wake"" words.  It has easy setup and bluetooth integration, and the amount of skills that are coming online open it to more creative applications than just a hands-free audio receiver.The bad:Amazon has not been forthcoming with what data this picks up and forwards to the cloud, especially when Alexa is not actively being used.  I mostly used my Echo Dot for weather/news in the morning, but it seems to be streaming data back constantly.  Just recently, after hearing a number of baby toys making sounds in our living room, Alexa turned on without prompting and said ""Here's some kids music I think you'll enjoy."" which was FAR more creepy than it was useful.The fact that the Echo Dot had been streaming to the cloud without prompt (despite its own FAQ: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230) left my wife and I a bit too uncomfortable to keep this on.  The short return period means that this will probably end up being an expensive hockey puck or coaster.  ""Alexa, hold my beer.""Conclusion:A neat product for what it is, but be aware that you're paying $50 for Amazon to store all of the sounds in your house so they can market to you.",2.0

I could not download the app outside of the US according to Google Play. After doing some research I was however finally able to download through Amazon Underground. Happy that I finally got the app and completed the setup, I explored and realised how useless this is outside of the US. I was a broken cookie. Or example with news and weather briefing, it only gives information for the US. I found no way for it to give news flash briefing for my country. Also with Tuning Radio, local radio stations that exists there cannot be found by Alexa. I began to get frustrated and angry.  Some of the basic features worked but are only useful if you re in the US. I am way disappointed and just wish I can get my money back.

The ""triggers"" and ""apps"" seem great until you realize that once you download them, you need to remember the trigger word for EACH one. so if you have 10 apps, you now need to remember EACH trigger word and the specific actions you can trigger for EACH app you downloaded. What the heck is the point of having an assistant if you're doing all the memorizing? Isn't this the same as having an app for everything on a smartphone? Except harder because you now have to memorize the apps you downloaded? So essentially, at this point, my Alexa is a glorified timer & music activator. It activates my Spotify reliably, and I'm sure it can turn your light on and off.

I bought one of these from a 3rd party retail store, and I LOVE it. I can't believe how it digs up music out of thin air, and tunes to radio stations simply by requesting the call letters.But I have a humble request. Fire TV, Apple TV, Blu Ray player, Audio system, TV, Remote extender, Clock, and who knows what else is already on the tables and shelves in our family rooms. The Dot is great, and it's not too large, but it's yet another piece of ""technocrap"" with a wire hanging out of it, in our homes.Y'know what would be cool? An in-wall hard-wired version of the Dot. Given the size of the Dot, I can easily see that this technology can be packed into the form of a light switch. It would be AWESOME to be able to install this in an electrical box. Of course that would mean millions of people talking to a wall, but us married folks do that already quite often. So it would be a nice change for the wall to actually listen and do what we ask it to do. If someone knows how I can float this idea to Amazon, it would be great.It wouldn't even have to be a big design change. All they need to do is build the Dot into a square or rectangle, and then make a light switched sized carrier for it so you can just drop it in. You could call the new product ""Dot2"", with the 2 being small and up to the right to mean ""Dot Squared"". Because I'd love to install this thing in the wall and have it out of sight.",5.0

Stuck between 3 and 4 stars, some days it's okay other days it's a stupid as a stone, it all depends on what your after but many things Alexa just does not know and it's sad. Alexa apparently does not have access to a search engine database because simple things that Google knows in a flash Alexa struggles with. Example, ""Alexa, what time is Staples open until?""  Reply ""I don't list business hours"", really? are you kidding me? That was what I think is an easy one. Instead Alexa relies on Apps with pre-programmed data contained within the App, if it's not in the App Alexa is clueless. It would be rather easy for this unit to connect to some search engine and get those answers but they chose not to. The world Alexa lives in is not as broad based as I thought it would be, it's limited to the content of the App and that alone, it's not creative or diverse and the negative replies are narrow also mainly saying the thing over & over which can be annoying as heck and frustrating too. ""Sorry I don't have the answer to that question"" is the biggie. Hear that one a few times in a row and you start to wonder why your talking to a plastic disc on the counter.

Update- So I finally found the issue on automation. It had to do with the way Alexa was tying into my Samsung Smartthings hub. I was originally trying to link it into the child account and not the master account. The problem is that the master account wasn't using a password. I just signed into Samsung using my phone without ever using a password. To link Alexa to my Samsung hub Alexa asks for a password but there wasn't one to give. Eventually I got one by doing a password reset on the Samsung website. I am still disappointed with the limited use of Alexa. I would have given this three stars if I didnt have to spend a few weeks trying various things to figure it out.Was very disappointed to find out this is nothing near the hype. I ask all kinds of things only to hear the reply ""hmmmmm don't know that one"". Aside from that I bought this and an echo so I could voice control my lights with my smart things hub. I have been doing all kinds of things for weeks and I cant get this to talk to my smart hub. It does tell me the weather and play music. Both of which I don't really have an interest in.

I have even go so far as to hold the device in my hand and speak loudly to it, still only responds when it feels like it.But – when you can get its attention, it works ok.. the music choice with Prime are outstanding and it can do most functions that I have managed to ask.  There is a lot of potential for this item.  But what kills it is the lack of response to the key word.  I should not have to yell at the device three or four times to get its attention.

Initially I was pretty excited about the Echo Dot, but found that it's quite limited in its functionality.  Basically I use it to set timers when I'm cooking, tell her to change the temperature on my Nest thermostat, sometimes to reorder stuff on Amazon, and to ask what the forecast is.  It is NOT like google where you can ask ""okay google, how long do I bake a potato?"" and it gives you an answer with time and temp for baking potato.  Alexa has no answers for you.  They keep emailing me cool things Alexa can now do, like give you funny answers to stupid questions, but I don't need her for entertainment.  I need hands free answers and directions.  There are some app type things you can download on her, like to order pizza from pizza hut or whatever, haven't used those.  Again, I just have a million random questions a day I need answers too, and she can't answer 9 out of 10 of them.I bought 2 of these when they were on sale for xmas, and over time realized I didn't like them.  Too late to return, or I'd return them and get the google version.Lastly, as I've become more and more disappointed by her presence, I get very angry if I ask her to do something and she doesn't hear me.  To avoid the anger, I just stay silent and get on my phone to do it, like change the temp using my Nest app.  It's like a sad, resentful marriage.

I bought the Dot with a single purpose in mind: voice control for my home automation system. There are many other reviews discussing Dot’s other features, but here I want to share my experience with voice control. I do use my Dot to get weather and flash briefings, amuse myself with Alexa’s jokes, and (occasionally) try new “skills”. Alexa and Dot make a mostly fine home automation control experience, with a few caveats. Here’s the scoop!Before I decided to try Dot I was looking for another scene controller to use in my living room. I have a Vera Plus home automation (HA) controller and large number of Leviton Vizia RF switches and dimmers around my home; there are eight devices in my living room alone, along with a Leviton wall mounted scene controller. I have scenes for reading, watching TV, early morning (dim lighting), cleaning, and so forth. In the living room it is tedious to get up to use the wall controller every time I want to make a change. In my bedroom, I use a MiniMote (a very small, 4-Button, handheld remote control made by Aeon Labs), which I keep on my nightstand. My first thought was to buy another one to use in the living room.While the MiniMote is a terrific device, I really didn’t want to have another remote to keep tabs on; it’s small and svelte, which means it would find itself under a couch cushion in less time than it takes to queue up the next episode of Veep. Voice control seemed to be the perfect answer. But cost was a concern. The MiniMote is available here on Amazon for $36.95, so competing on cost would be a challenge. I was willing to pay more for voice control (Leviton scene and zone controls are in the $100+ range), but only if it worked. When I stumbled onto the Dot, I realized that if it worked I might never need a handheld or wall mounted controller. And any other benefits of Alexa would be free extras.So how well does it work? I’m very satisfied and it is absolutely better that a handheld remote. Dot sits inconspicuously on a side table near the front of the living room. I can set a scene for reading with “Alexa, turn on Reading”, which turns on the floor lamp, sets the pendant lights over the couch to 40%, the coffee bar lights to 20%, and turns off the media center and fireplace lighting.As to the caveats:-My experience has been that most of the time Alexa will flawlessly understand and execute my commands. If there is background noise it occasionally won’t work, for example when watching TV.-Occasionally Alexa simply misunderstands my annunciation, which I attribute to my occasionally sloppy New England accent. Repeating the command clearly nearly always works the second time.-Configuration and setup (at least with Vera) is crucial to getting the results you want. Naming your devices simply is the best approach. Even with my large number of switches and dimmers this wasn’t too challenging, however I don’t try to control every device from the living room.-The protocol for scenes is “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.  If you have a scene that turns off devices you will still say “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.-You must avoid using the words “On” or “Off” in your scene names. Alexa confuses the On and Off actions with the name of an action.-The protocol for turning on or off a specific device is “Alexa, Turn [On or Off] [room name] [device name]”. For example, “Alexa, Turn On Living Room Floor Lamps” or “Alexa, Set Living Room Coffee Bar Lights to 40 percent”-Occasionally Alexa responds to my scene command that “some devices did not respond” even though things worked as expected. I not sure why this happens, probably Vera is too slow to respond through the various cloud interfaces.Wish list:One feature I really feel needs to be implemented is the ability to secure Dot access. I would use them in more places, however I’m not comfortable with having everyone in the house be able to trigger things.Bottom line:I’m glad I tried the Alexa interface to my Vera and I’d easily recommend it to anyone. The convenience of hands-free access to my HA devices is worth those infrequent misses.",4.0

If you have Google Music you will need to switch to Amazon Music. 3 of 7 songs I requested were not found. I have a smart tv, a smart phone, a new laptop, etc. I do not wish to spend thousands of dollars in upgrades for technology that will be obsolete or that will need more upgrades because what I already own is not an Amazon product (although they were purchased through Amazon).

I am an Echo owner and bought the dot in order to not only expand Alexa's coverage area, but mainly to take advantage of the audio-out jack feature that is absent on the Echo.  I'm not going to fill this review with everything I like about these units; instead, I'm going to zero in on the one (in my opinion) major flaw of the Dot that caused me to knock off a star in an otherwise 5-star product.The main reason for me wanting the Dot was due to the audio-out jack which would allow me to attach the device to my whole-house audio system and pump the audio output into multiple rooms in the house.  The problem lies in the fact that once something is plugged into the audio jack of the Dot, the built-in speaker no longer functions at all.There are two problems with this situation. One is that if I don't have the audio system turned on in the room with the Dot, I cannot hear any responses from Alexa, since she talks via the audio jack only.  (This is especially a problem to me, since I use Alexa to turn on that same audio system.)  The other problem is that, if someone is listening to the music that is streaming from the Dot in another room, they will be interrupted with Alexa's responses anytime someone talks to her in the main room.  The latter is not that big of a deal, and actually may be useful in some situations; however, the former is a deal-breaker.What I would like to see is that, when something is plugged into the audio jack, only streamed music is fed to that device, while feedback from Alexa remains to be played via the built-in speaker.  Of course, not everyone would want it this way, so this would need to be a user adjustable setting in the Alexa app.  Another setting would be to chose whether Alexa feedback plays via just the internal speaker, or to the audio jack also.I'm not sure how the jack is wired internally -- I fear that the disconnection from the internal speaker might be a hard connections within the jack itself (as opposed to software directing the output to the separate sound devices; internal speaker, or audio jack).  If it is not switched via the hardware, then this could easily be just a firmware update, so I'm not giving up hope just yet.Hopefully Amazon sees this reviews and considers this change in further hardware/software updates of the Dot.  I am guessing there are many others out there like me, for whatever reason, that would welcome these options.  If you do share my view on this feature, please add a comment and/or like this review -- maybe that will bring enough attention to get this into the hands of Amazon's R&D department.",4.0

It's also great to set a timer, or to check the weather, or hear the news for the day. My kids like to ask Alexa to tell them jokes. I'm sure there are other ways to use Alexa but we haven't really messed around with it. We gave the Smart Plug to turn on things wirelessly which is really useful. You can just say ""Alexa, turn on the kids room lamp"".Negatives:If you have the radio/music too loud though, you end up having to yell ""Alexa!"" several times for her to hear you, just to make a command to stop or skip the song, etc. I feel like a crazy person yelling ""Alexa! Alexa! Alexa!"" My kids even do it. The neighbors must think I have a dog named Alexa.We have the TP-Link Smart Plug and have the lamp plugged into it, so we can easily ask Alexa to turn on the lamp. Usually she just turns it off quietly when I say ""Alexa, turn off the lamp"". But sometimes,  she doesn't hear you, and she answers back with this long dialogue of ""I'm sorry, there is no device called living room xxxxx"" SO LOUDLY (because it was set at a loud volume from whatever you did earlier that day) that I just wished I had been able to turn off a light switch, old-school style!

Even though the Dot itself is a great tool (I have three of them), the Alexa application for Apple products is never online so I can't manage or edit my shopping list, to-do lists, Calendar items, and alarms.  The only way to get it back online is to restart my iPad and iPhone, which is inconvenient.  I was forced to use a shopping list application from the AppStore instead of the Alexa app.Also, if you set alarms for the same time Monday through Friday and want to stop just one alarm for one day, it cancels all the alarms so I'm forced to restart my iPhone to get the Alexa app to engage and then I'm able to restore the alarms.  The only way around this is to set individual alarms for each day, but you are still not able to ""pause"" an alarm without cancelling them entirely.  (and yes, my iPhone patches are up to date)Outside of that, it's great getting the weather, setting timers, playing music from pandora, and lots of other features.",3.0

The machine functions generally as I expected.  It was easy to set up and get started.  Alexa's voice is clear and I was easily able to integrate with my stereo system to stream music via my home stereo system.The one complaint I have about the dot is my ability to handle volume management.  I wish the Dot included a manual fine-tune volume control of the music I stream.  For example, when I ask Alexa to reset volume level to the next level (up or down) I find that the result is always a bit too low or high to suit my needs; there is no fine tune.One key reason I purchased the Dot was to replace a media server/appliance (Logitech Squeezebox) which I have been using for years, but which is no longer supported by the manufacturer.  The phone app which I use to control playlists selection for the Squeezebox has a very nice volume control.  It lets set my exact specification in small increments.  So, if I'm entertaining I can simply pull out my phone and quietly control volume, or changes in playlist, in my view far more effectively.Of course, any need to immediately music streamed is handled very effectively through the Dot.  But frankly I find that I prefer to use my media server and appliance vs. the dot because of this basic functionality.  I guess I will continue to do so unless I see the type of changes I need.I am not suggesting a major change in the Dot – manage everything by communicating through Alexa; it’s powerful.  However, I am suggesting that the functionality of the Alexa app be updated to provide this capability which would allow me to control music streaming changes either by speaking to Alexa or through the Alexa app on my phone.Thank you.",3.0

Fun and promising. For Pandora/music, it is great. For alarms, functional. For commanding lights in your house using Phillips Hue, sub-par. I bought this as a bundle and may be forced to return it when I return the Phillips Hue. Also, when it is at rest, it rotates through colors, which distracts me when I am on the computer.I could not find a YouTube ""skill"", so I would be forced to pay for Amazon music if I want to get random stuff I have yet to pay for or place on my phone. Also, it loudly declares when it has re-paired with a device, which is good and bad. Probably doesn't do that if you have set up ""do not disturb"" hours, but that setting was unclear when I saw it.I almost want to keep it just to ask it random questions, play background music (""rainforest skill"") or Pandora hands-free. Even though using Pandora on my phone is faster and more intuitive to get exactly what I want, I do tend to like anything from any of my playlists, so it works. The blinking is bothering me again. Stop blinking Alexa. I mean, ""Alexa, stop blinking."" Go ahead and try ""Alexa, are you lying."" or ""Alexa, stop blinking.""Strangely, sometimes Alexa tells you it doesn't know ""how to do that"", but other times it just makes a beep sound and stops listening. Keyword/phrase for software engineers: non-deterministic results with actual human voice (humans don't sound the same way every time).I see that it has a lot of skills, but I see that in the same way I see the Android store: full of stuff people have abandoned or don't maintain. I installed one ""skill"", for example, and interacted with it a few times. On the last attempt, it said it was having trouble connecting. Until the store and the skills are running on the same platform, you can't rely on any or all of it working. It is good and bad. You don't have one point of failure, but the fact that the skills are in a ""store"", I think they'll eventually start charging for the good ones. Maybe there are some good ones, but I feel like they should be recommended as part of the Alexa from the get-go. Basically, this could be the future, or it could be a gimmicky half-baked thing that takes forever to really get running (except the stuff that already gives Amazon more money and everyone else little) that records you, provides another place for your personal data to be stolen from, etc. I could go on and on. I wanted it to be better than it is, but maybe it can't be better because of the way it was architected. Alexa, grow up.Also, one time Alexa did this strange thing. It was playing background music, but then it overlayed something else on top of it when I asked it to do something. It seemed like it was its own theme song. If I were superstitious or worried about AI, I would think it was mocking me and making it hard for me to tell for sure. Now that I think about it, this thing boots up for the first time with a sound that I would say is on the creepy side for the anti-AI folk. There are better boot-up sounds for AI-like devices...more widely acceptable ones equally non-annoying.Oh, if you have your computer paired with this and you are running Google Chrome, if you open a new tab, it will pause whatever sound is being played by Alexa even if the tab plays no sound. That is jarring. This thing needs to be better able to fade between inputs in case an input indicates sound may be imminent, but then outputs nothing.",3.0

Smart home apps aside, Alexa is quite limited and isn't as full of information as one would expect. Her physical design is beautiful. Her voice and demeanor pleasing. However, she just didn't have all, or even most of the answers we were looking for.You will have to enable ""Skills"" which are kind of mini-apps for many of the answers Alexa will provide. For many you will need to remember an ""activation"" word that will tell Alexa which mini-app to access for information. For example, there is a Good Housekeeping skill that helps with advice on common homemaking questions and it's activation word is ""Good Housekeeping.""  You have to say, ""Alexa ask Good Housekeeping how to remove a wine stain.""  Multiply that by 100's (currently) of skills and you can see where this might become a problem. There should be no need to tell Alexa which Skill to access to get information. Her only competitor, Google Home doesn't require that and we all know why. Google is Google.Will Alexa compete, ultimately, with the oceans of knowledge Google Home provides? Unless Amazon finds some way to make Alexa much smarter without the user having to point to her where to look, I don't think so. I was saddened to find this out with our new Christmas present, Alexa. I do like her very much and she will remain in our home to, hopefully, grow and develop. Truthfully, we will also be trying Google Home. Perhaps they will talk to each other, someday.",3.0

There's not much I can add that hasn't been said before, since the Echo Dot is constantly being improved, and anything I say today could be wrong tomorrow.  Mine has been especially poor for movie theater information, but I like it a lot for weather, news, radio, podcasts, and encyclopedia-type questions.  It's even really nice for background music, and seems to have nearly all albums available, including even the Beatles and Stones catalog. The sound quality of the internal speaker is hard to describe, but it's somewhere between, say, a cell phone's speakerphone and a decent Bluetooth speaker or table radio.  There's no bass at all, and little sparkle to the high frequencies, but within its limits, it presents a smooth, un-distorted sound that might exceed your expectations.  The 1/8"" headphone jack enables me to connected the Dot to my primary stereo system or to plug in my Shure studio monitor headphones.  It sounds great with either -- or at least as good as 256Kb/sec compressed audio can sound.  If I could add just one feature, the Dot is crying out for cell phone integration.  How cool would it be to be able to announce ""Alexa, Call Lilly"", and be able to walk around your home hands-free while talking to your friend (as long as she's not named Alexa).  Or to have Alexa announce, ""Incoming call from Donald, would you like to accept?"" (hint, don't take the call).",4.0

Everything is supported by both the Echo and Google Home. Google Home is also much better at understanding the context of my questions. Furthermore, Google Home works seamlessly with my phone and tablet (Android) so it extends the functionality to wherever I am.I have thus far found few cases where the Echo is better than Google Home. I ordered both a Dot and the full Echo and will be returning the full Echo unopened. The tie-in with Chromecast with Google Home is also quite nice though it still needs work, i.e. with music support.

It also doesn't seem to hear as well when it's already playing something; I feel like I have to shout at it. Might be because it's short and not getting a direct line of sight (hearing?) to my voice. This isn't an issue with the normal Echo -- that one hears amazingly well even when cranked up. Oh, and on that note, the Echo Dot doesn't have a ring you can turn to adjust volume, which I sometimes miss when I'm sitting right next to it. You have to ask her, which interrupts the program.It's fine for bedside, as a suplimental instance of Alexa in the house, which is where we use it, and also to control home automation outlets in our room. I think best music usage would be to hook it up via Bluetooth to a speaker, which the normal Echo can't do.I would dissuade someone from buying this as a primary, first experience with the Echo.

I attempted to read all of the terms and conditions but soon found out that agreeing to them means that third parties can end up with my voice print!  Also, if one tells Alexa to buy a tune, then credit information is shared with any third party, which in turn has their own terms and conditions for use and, results in further sharing of financial data and one's voice print.

I have talked to customer service but I guess this glitch bothers me more than them.  I want her to tell me the Alexa price and then apply the discount.  To do otherwise is misleading.

I bought both echo dot and google home to try out which one I like more. The most basic comparison boils down to the following:Pros (for Echo)- Cheaper than google home, even though a more proper comparison would be Echo vs Google home (both have speakers) in which case Google home wins. But I don't care about the onboard speaker.- Google home doesn't come with a 'dot' version like Echo. I would always like to have my own speakers paired and don't care much for the onboard speaker. It unnecessary increased the cost of the Google home..- Echo dot can pair to any speaker by Bluetooth. Google home has Bluetooth but can't use it, only chromecast audio or cast enabled speakers.- Both can support a large array of home automation devices including IFTTT but typically echo has more ready-made customization as of now. Doing the same with Google home needs more programming knowledge.Cons (against echo):- Google home can couple multiple speakers and play songs on all speakers in a group at once- I had bought Bluetooth receivers from amazon for my current speakers, which work fine, but the Bluetooth connection with echo dropped every now and then and I had to re-pair. In contrast, Google home cast speakers never drop connection.- Google home is smarter than Alexa. By a mile. Period. You realize that when you ask stuff to both, you can string commands together with google home and it will automatically pick up the reference. You can play a lot more songs with google home than with alexa, simply because it can somehow find songs on Spotify that alexa couldn't.- Google home has multi user voice recognition, and can take multiple emails and calendars- Google home does not try to push you to buy stuff like echo/Amazon- Range of hearing is not as good as google home. I have even been able to use the wake word to start google home from as far as 35 ft away. Echo, nearly half is the best I could do.Eventually I returned the Echo, because a good AI is very important for a home assistant.",3.0

It's a reasonable expectation that if I'm playing music on one Echo device, I would have the option of simultaneously playing it on the other devices in my home, like a Sonos system.

Even though it claims to use Big search engine; for simple searches, most of the time, it will just tell you to look at your phone to have it follow a link that it puts in the  Alexa app.2. It claims that it can link via Bluetooth to play your music from, but you are not told that you can not do searches. To be able to do this, you need to pay Amazon 7.99 a month to play your own music library (you have to upload your music to their cloud and only the first 250 songs are free).3. Simple functions like: ""Alexa, how to you say cat in Spanish"" does not work. You have to add a skill and then say ""Alexa, ask translator to say cat in Spanish"". Since Amazon claim that Alexa uses Bing, if I go to Bing and ask the same question, I get a correct response.4. Look at Google offering, Google Home.

Speak and it will be so. This stuff is from the future. I'm pretty confident that someone from the future traveled back in time, sold the idea of the Echo to Amazon and then traveled back to the future. You think they would've brought back the cure for cancer or how to produce unlimited clean energy, but the Echo Dot gets close-ish.I mainly got it to connect it to my studio monitors in my living room and play some music. Now I end up using it for much more than that. I've had several people ask me the same stuff over and over, so here's a list of FAQs.Q1. If it's always listening to you, can Amazon listen to our conversation right now?A1. Yes, it is always listening. No, Amazon cannot listen to our conversation right now. The way it works is that the Echo is only triggered when it hears the key word (alexa, echo, amazon). Then it picks up whatever you say after that and runs the command. It doesn't need an internet connection to wake up, meaning the conversations are not being sent to Amazon to process if you said the keyword and come back with a yes/no. I've also monitored the internet traffic on the Echo and it does not transfer any data until it hears a command.Q2. How far do you have to be to hear you?A2. My kitchen is approximately 30 feet away without walls from my Echo. I can speak in a regular voice and it will pick it up. My dining room is around 25 feet but the voice needs to go through a door and turn left before it reaches the Echo. That works fine but I do need to speak just a touch louder and be more clear.Q3. Do you have to wait for the Echo to light up before you give it a command?A3. No, you can say ""Alexa, volume 4"" as if you were talking normally and it will understand.Q4. Does it condense answers if you ask a question based on its findings? For example, how does it respond to ""Alexa, how many hours does a 3 month old baby need to sleep a day?""A4. Currently, the search engine can do simple searches and calculations, such as who is the president or what's 500ml in ounces. It's not up to the task of answering more difficult questions, condensing the answer and responding back. In the baby sleep example, it will say it cannot find what you're looking for. I believe the Google Home device will be much better at this.Q5. OK so it can play music, ask the weather, get some news and answer simple questions. What else?A5. While I mainly use it for music, weather and simple questions, one additional feature I've really enjoyed is the connection with my Honeywell WiFi thermostat. I can say, ""Alexa, set the thermostat to 78"" and off it goes. I have made an Amazon order in the past, but it was a one time thing because Amazon was offering $10 off by ordering via the Echo. I'm more comfortable using my phone for purchases. I should also note that the Echo has a bunch of ""skills"" or you can consider them as apps that will extend the functionality. For example, you can add a Harry Potter Trivia skill and it will start asking you HP trivia questions. The number of skills available is quite extensive, but the number of useful skills is fairly low. Still, it's a great platform to developers to start introducing new functionality.I have the Echo Dot 1st gen and 2nd gen now. Both works very well, although I personally prefer the design of the first Echo Dot. Is it worth $50? I see a lot of value in having the Echo Dot always available to play some music or answer some questions. It sure is nice being able to speak a playlist I want to listen to in Pandora or Amazon Music rather than opening my phone, launching an app, navigating through my playlists and selecting something. Given its near flawless execution and services provided by Amazon, I can see how this is the future.",5.0

Amazon gave people a reason to try out home AI this year when they released this product, a standalone/tiny version of the larger Echo.  I have used the Echo Dot for about 1 week and have found it to be a pleasant, albeit flawed, device.The only difference between the two models from what I can tell is size and sound quality.  This is to ignore the second, mid-sized ""Echo Tap"" which only has value as a portable speaker and is not suited for use within the home.  The way this product, the Dot, was advertised led me to believe it needed to be plugged into an external speaker in order to work however it does in fact have a built-in speaker and can be used by itself.  The speaker is neither loud nor dynamic but it puts sound in the room when you need it to.The biggest flaw for me is with Amazon's dirty policy of refusing to allow competing services to work on it's devices.  I pay for streaming music through Google Play; however I cannot use the Echo to access this music because Amazon wants me to purchase music from them instead.  At the same time, Amazon has the Prime Video service I pay for;  they do not allow my google devices, such as my Chromecast-enabled television, to access Prime video because Amazon wants me to buy a stupid Fire stick instead.  The real craziness here is that Amazon runs it's entire Fire ecosystem on Android because Google gives it away for free (so there really is no excuse).In the end, I want to recommend this device because it's cheap, it's well-designed, and it's the first step in the new wave of home tech.  But at the same time, Amazon's policy of exclusion really hurts consumers and hinders their own success.  If you are a person who uses ""competing services"" such as Netflix, Tidal, Apple Music or Google Play, you probably want to wait for a more universally compatible home AI.",3.0

We use the shopping list function (which is the best feature because it automatically and instantly syncs to associated smart phones). We use the Prime music through Alexa. Anything else is just novelty. There are a few tasks that I am disappointed Alexa cannot do, but expected with this type of device. #1- You cannot set a reminder. ""Alexa, at 4pm tomorrow remind me to pick up the kids from practice"", this will not work. #2- I would like to be able to leave a message for someone else in the household. ""Alexa, remind Mary to take out the garbage"", again, not a function echo can do. #3- I'd like to be able to send someone a voice message or text, such as ""Alexa, send a text to Mary that we have 6pm reservations at Tormons Streakhouse"" Nope.

So, why I give it 4?. To start off, let me say that I LOOOVVEEE the Echo Dot! I mean this thing has transform my daily life in ways not possible before owning it. Linked up to an Harmony Hub, this little circle thingy becomes a killer component in the world of automation. From orders, scheduling to automation, Alexa does it all; Well, almost :-). It was a breeze getting it setup and in no time I was calling Alexa, Alexa, Alexa. I took time to add some ""Skills"" to Alexa and make it even more helpful. From cocktail recipes to playing Jeopardy, you are bound to find a ""Skill"" that you'll like to add.So, why 4 stars when I marvel at the product so much?Well, the missing stars is for functionality still missing from Alexa which I consider necessary to make it the ultimate assistant.Some of the thing that the Alexa can't do so far but hopefully soon will be able to do:- Notifications: This is a BIG one missing for me to elevate Alexa to queen status. Currently Alexa is a ONE-WAY street. There are no way to make it read notifications back to you on its own. If you don't say ""Alexa...."" it will not send you info without hearing from you. So, it's not like your phone with PUSH notifications. So, so far you are not able to have it read the news, give you reminders or announce the weather on its own at a specific set time. It seems that Google Home (Alexa's fierce new competitor) can do two-way to an extant already. There's a demonstration from a Google keynote where they show Google Home notify a flight delayed on its own without the owner asking it. So, in my opinion, Alexa should and can be TWO-WAY. I actually expect this functionality to become available in some near future upgrade/update.- Alarms: I consider Alexa's alarm decent but still not advanced. We can use some preset tones (and about 5 celebrity voices). However, we can't let's say, ask Alexa to set Alarms with a specified Spotify playlist or Amazon Prime Music. Currently for me that's a bummer.- Alexa Custom Names: No hate for the ""Alexa"" name but it would be great if Amazon allow us to rename the device to other name that we probably love more than ""Alexa"".- Multi-Room support: Multiple Echo devices can't be sync together so far to play audio through a whole house (something Google Home can do). No biggie for me but this should be available in case its needed for future use.- Translation: BIG disappointment there. Alexa should have had this function built in from the start. I asked Alexa a simple question: ""Alexa, translate how are you in Spanish"" as a test and to my disappointment its response was ""huhmm, I don't know"" and instead add a link from Bing to the Alexa mobile app.I believe all I've listed will be added and implemented at some point. At least that's the hope I'm keeping in Amazon to keep working on making Alexa the best of the best! And, yes! That one star missing will be added down the line when all is done :-)",4.0

Typical of what one can expect these days.The device is okay I guess, but the manual jerks.So in the instructions for connecting an external speaker say to use a ""3.5mm audio jack"".WHAT KIND OF 3.5MM AUDIO JACK?There are three kinds of 3.5mm audio jacks that I can think of.  Use the wrong one and it won't work right, might even damage the dot.Typical ""THROW THE CUSTOMER UNDER THE BUS""-------------------------------------------------------Few days later now, I experimented to sort out what's up with the speaker jack.You can use either a smartphone plug, such as the plug on smartphone headsets, or a stereo mini-jack.  In either case the output is monophonic into only one channel.The writers of this manual did not know what they were doing.The instructions refer to this jack as an ""aux"" jack in one place, and a ""speaker"" jack in another place.It is, in fact, an aux jack, aka auxiliary jack.If you plug a speaker directly into this jack it will sound weak and tinny.  And it may eventually damage guts of the Dot.When they say ""speaker"" jack, they may be referring to an AMPLIFIED speaker.  Many computer speakers are amplified speakers.  This is actually two things in one, an amplifier plus a speaker.So if you are using an amplified speaker, you can plug it directly into this jack.INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONNECTING AN AMPLIFIED SPEAKER:If it is a single channel speaker you can just plug it in and you're in business.  Wahoo!If it is a stereo speaker,  just plugging it in will give you audio on only one channel.  If that's okay with you, then cool.  If you want monophonic sound coming from both speakers then you need an adapter.  Specifically, a mini jack mono-to-stereo adapter, such as the Philmore 560A.

I hate dead links.https://smile.amazon.com/Philmore-560A-Stereo-stereo-mono-Adapter/dp/B008YOFQMQ/ref=sr_1_18?ie=UTF8&qid=1478719869&sr=8-18&keywords=mini+jack+adapter+mono+to+stereoSo, plug the adapter into the Dot, and your stereo speaker jack into the adapter.  Good luck.  This is a tricky business.INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONNECTING A SPEAKER WITHOUT INTERNAL AMP:You will need an amplifier, like the Lepai LP-A68.  Here's an Amazon link:https://smile.amazon.com/Lepai-LP-A68-Digital-Amplifier-Remote/dp/B00721Z1AE/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1478720274&sr=8-7&keywords=lepai+lepyI know, you got the Dot because of the appealing price, and now I'm telling you to fork out another 20+ clams.  Such is life.Now there's two ways you can connect this. If you want to use one speaker, cool, the output of the Dot is monophonic anyway.  But if you need to fill a room with two speakers, then you need to use the adapter described above.FOR CONNECTING HEADPHONES,Follow the same instructions for ""speaker without  internal amp"".In the case of headphones it's probably more important to have both channels working.  Use the adapter.If you don't and you listen for extended periods with only one channel working, you head will involuntarily tilt to one side.",2.0

Best little unit! My father has the original which, for him is great. I waited almost a year before investing in this little baby and having the option to pay $10.00 a month was a no brainer. I was not fond of the full sound that comes from the unit BUT that is the trade off when buying into a portable sound item (keep in mind that you have to have the DOT plugged in unless you use another power source like, an extended battery/charger which, I may look into. Soooo, I bought the Oontz Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth speaker WHICH some reviews claim it not so great however, I can tell you that it absolutely made all the difference for my needs. I come home from work and ask Alexa to play whatever genre I am in the mood to listen to INSTEAD of turning my TV on AND, I will tell you that I LOVE to watch my flicks but somehow this little DOT forces me to out my head into a place of less ""noise"". I choose to filter what is more important to me as, you should. Is the DOT perfect? is Alexa perfect? No, I ask Alexa questions like, ""when were humans first created?"", she cannot respond but ask her what the SUN is made up of or if there is a chance that life on MARS is possible and she will give you an answer. When you wake up, you can say, ""Alexa, Good Morning and she will respond. On April 1st, Fools Day, I said, ""Alexa, Goodnight"" and her response was, ""Good night and don't forget to fool someone before the day is over"", pretty smart technology. Do I plan on buying more, yes I do. Give it try but DO buy a separate portable speaker for an enhanced experience.Update: I just purchased my 2nd Dot and with my Amazon Prime account, I got it in 2 days! I simply love these Dots; well worth the cost as it pays for itself between my audible books, heart Radio and Pandora accounts. I have one in my living room and the other in my bedroom - great alternative to having the TV on and, I love to watch my movies but to chill out with the Dot to decompress from your day, you cannot go wrong!!",5.0

Every single day I find myself saying ""OMG, I haven't heard this song in soooo long!"" Ok, now for the one BIG CON, there is absolutely zero consistency in the volume from one song to the next. Even if it's impossible to accomplish this in such a large and varied music library, the DEVICE should absolutely regulate the volume level. I can have the volume on 5 and suddenly there's a song I can barely hear, I turn it up a bit and then the next track ends up (way) too loud. I'm just waiting to hear complaints from the other apartments. Not only that, but when it's too loud Alexa can't hear you tell it to lower the volume without yelling. !!!!! Another big issue, THE APP SUCKS! Seriously, Amazon? It's a joke.Also, the playlists should play on a loop. I'm sick of it shutting off when it's gone through the whole list.Voice recognition needs work, Alexa can't add songs to your playlists, and if I didn't buy this thing primarily for the music I'd be pretty disappointed because it doesn't seem to do much else worth buying it for.

White is not white but Alexa is working well. I was excited to get the new Echo Dot after I recently bought an Amazon Echo on Prime Day. Our twins love the Echo and I was looking forward to adding a Dot to their bedroom. I purchased two Dots, one white and one black. I will list some of the Pros and Cons, I realize some of this will be my expectations I would want from this device in the future.PROShipping! Wow Ordered and shipped the same day. Received and installed the next day. Why is getting something the day after you ordered so great?Packaging is very niceQuality of the product - the cords the device are all high qualityForm factor - I like the size and feel of the Echo Dot it is sturdy and not too large for a nightstand. I do love the light ring too.Performance - Voice recognition is very good.CONSThe white Echo Dot is not White. Well part of it is white but the top is black, the cord is black. I have a white nightstand and I was hoping that the white version would tie in nicely. What I have is a two tone dot with a white side and a black top with a black cord running to it all on top of a white nightstand. So be aware you are only buying a white sided device.Sound quality is okay. The larger Echo is great but the Dot is very tinny sounding with very little bass note.Setup - The information contained in the package re: setup was minimal and did not address the scenario if you already have an Echo on your system. I figured out fairly quickly but it could be improved.Performance - I guess I would expect the Echo system to perform similar to my Sonos system where I can enable playback across all my speakers in all my rooms. So why can't I have music that is playing on my Echo also play on my Dots? These are all operated on my Alexa app and all are on my wireless network, am I missing something? Shouldn't that be a function? I would love to have a distributed audio system with my Amazon Echo products.I am happy but I won't buy more Dots for my other rooms at this time.",3.0

We have four 2nd generation dots, one 1st generation dot, and 1 Amazon echo.  So it's safe to say, we're an Alexa household. :) I love the dots, here are some of the ways we use them most frequently.In the bedroom, living room, and office we use them to turn on and off the lights. We live in an older house, where not many rooms have overhead lighting... so this was huge.  I know it's so lazy, but it's soooo nice being able to get under the sheets and then just say ""Alexa, Bedroom Lights Off"".  And in the morning it helps us wake up, turning the lights on from bed, then actually getting out of bed :).As a white noise machine.  Every night we ask Alexa to play white noise (we found a sound we like the most).  But we also use her for classical and spa music whenever we're working at home.To check the weather.To check my commute.To check scores of games.To create a shopping list.To set timers/alarms.To tell us a joke.Occasionally to have someone to yell at.  When you each have an hour plus commute and stressful jobs, sometimes it's nice to be able to snap at someone but not feel guilty about it.To listen to music. While cooking, showering, or really anything. Research has proven households who listen to music are happier.  And we actually listen to music with Alexa because it's so easy.With all that being said, I love my Alexa devices... but there are still a few things I don't like.The white dots don't have a white cord or top (or bottom for that matter).  So if you're looking for the white to blend in with your white furniture... it won't work all that well. (See picture)The dots/Amazon Alexa are NOT connected.  I guess this is great that we can play different music in different rooms... but when the kitchen timer is going off and I'm sitting in the living room--it's annoying hearing ""no timer is set"" when you're trying to turn it off.Sometimes the bedroom Alexa picks us up when we're in the kitchen.  Which drives us bonkers when it picked us up setting a timer (see above.)Alexa still has a lot of learning to do.  She still doesn't understand many of our questions (things that should be able to be answered by Wikipedia, etc.)",4.0

Beware of her deals. I have six of these and two echos.  I like the music.  I like listening to the radio from my hometown.  I like the timer and alarm and the ability to get weather from a variety of places.  What I don't like is using her to order stuff. She certainly has deals but she won't use a gift card balance.  And while you can get on your computer to change this it is a hassle.  If you have a vacation home you will not be able to change the shipping address even moments after the order has been placed.  If you ask your husband if you need what she is offering, you take a chance that it is gone even though it is not a timed deal and it is only been a couple of minutes.  But most important, if you have an Amazon promotional credit that you are expected in a couple of days and if that credit email comes early, like right as you are ordering on Alexa, she will give you a terrific price never telling you that her price is $10 more and that unbeknownst to you she has used your credit.  I have talked to customer service but I guess this glitch bothers me more than them.  I want her to tell me the Alexa price and then apply the discount.  To do otherwise is misleading.  Their solution is to order through Alexa and then get on the computer.  Defeats the purpose.  Besides she already used my promotional credit without telling me and making me think I got a better deal than I did.",3.0

I spoke to Amazon, and for the first time they were totally unhelpful, and after leaving me on hold for awhile simply told me that something had happen to the device' hard drive and it would need to be replaced. Any protection I appeared to have on the device was only good for 90 days.

As recently as November 27, 2016 a reviewer from the Columbus Dispatch wrote, ""...devices work by listening for your voice at all times, something that just feels creepy.""Creepier still to me was that it saved recorded voice recordings, too; and, deleting them had repercussions for what Alexa ""learned."" There were times when reviewing recordings, I was not pleased with what it heard seconds prior to my issuing commands.But my primary reasons were the need for Amazon to retain my wireless pass code and to link all the specialized apps that gave Echo Dot its ""skills.""In ""The Daily Dot,"" blog on November 16, 2016, Austin Powell, managing editor cites Bruce Schneier, ""Internet Pioneer"" and his testimony before members of Congress about the dangers of ""the internet of things."" The post's title is ""'The internet era of fun and games is over'."" To my point Schneier used as an example the October 2016 internet denial of service attack, and one of his primary ""truths"" was ""‘There are new vulnerabilities in the interconnections.""So, short of outright paranoia, my reason for returning my Echo Dot was the way it worked made me feel uncomfortable.",2.0

Placement of dot is crucial for a good experience.- Only supports english and german for now- Not very competent at answering general questions and you need to activate skills to expand this functionality.

I really enjoy my Echo Dot, but at this point it is more a novelty than an assistant, as it is inconsistent and some of the interfacing is clunky.For example, I have it connected to a single smartbulb with a specific name.  Sometimes I will give a command to dim or brighten it, and have Alexa respond that there are ""several devices with that name, which one do I want?""  There is ONE device with that name.  At least Siri never gaslighted me.  Other times the same exact command will work.The Flash Briefing and timer functions are very good, though some content providers are far better than others, and a handful appeared to disappear since I first started using them less than a month ago.  The alarm works as it should, and some of the other Skills/Apps are fine so long as you remember the exact keyword.One other peeve is that if you ask for certain things by the wrong name, Alexa will try to prompt you to sign up for a paid subscription and can't be halted until the pitch is done.

Many of the podcasts I listen to weren't recognized by Alexa, and I could only play the most recent episodes of the ones it did recognize.

My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.

It also reply's it doesn't know how to answer your question if you ask it anything.  Example: ""Alexa; What is the core temperature of the Earth?"" Reply:"" Hmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question""  That is the canned response you get for everything. Of course it uses the BING search engine so right off that makes it a joke to use as Bing is a useless search engine. So she says you can get more info by going online, then what the hell do I need you for then.  She is okay at setting alarms, but you can't get it to stop once it gets going.  I literally had to unplug the stupid thing to get it to stop once.  Also if you want to play music it is a pain to get it to do what you want.  First you have to load the Amazon App on your computer to be able to upload your music library to their server.  Sorry but I really don't another unsecured piece of garbage software on my machine, Why can't I load it from a web interface. You have to jump through so many hoops it just becomes more hassle than it is worth.  If you want to play anything from iheart radio, good luck trying to figure out how to make your favorite stations play.  I don't know about the integration of home products like Nest or other, maybe it is more useful in that sense.  I have had plenty of time with this device and overall I am very disappointed in it.  Sure you can find 10000 commands online to talk to it, but when you really want to know something, it just doesn't have enough understanding.  Limiting the search function really cripples the device.  The only fun thing you can do is call Alexa names and talk bad to it and listen to the responses but even that wears thin after 10 minutes.

Once it was actually transmitting to the Wave radio....THAT is when it failed miserably.  Frequent drop outs / loss of connection to the WiFi if you talked to it.  At other times it would simply not understand what you were asking.  In either case it would lock up / do nothing until it restored itself.  It seemed like in my layman's opinion that the processor could not handle multi tasking and / or the microphones were somehow corrupted when the Bluetooth was in use.  That for me was a deal killer so it went back.",2.0

The Echo Dot as a unit is well done, it's compact and attractive, affordable and functions as advertised. My only criticism is with the Alexa feature, which is still lacking in a lot of pertinent information. For example, it could not answer these questions: ""How old is the Irish language?"" or ""What is considered the most popular Christmas movie?"" or ""What are the most common names in Portugal?"" or ""What is the age of the oldest person alive?"" or ""What is the record high temperature for this day?"" etc. If you want the weather for Des Moines or the distance in miles from the earth to the moon or anything else that might be already listed on Wikipedia then Alexa will work for you.

I gave my Echo to my parents and replaced it with three 2nd generation dots. The dots make the Echo not worth the price difference since the only difference is the speaker. Even at 49.99 you could get a much better speaker than the one that is built into the Echo for the $130.00 price difference. It's good for older people like my parents who don't understand that and just think a speaker is a speaker. Anyways one dot is lined into my home theater and the other shared with the speaker I use for the pc when I want to use them for music. Having a dot in multiple rooms is great because you can voice control anything from anywhere in your house. I have 3 in a 1400 sq/ft two bedroom and do not need a fourth. Mine do have some connectivity issues and I find them unable to connect to the internet from time to time, an issue I NEVER had with the Echo. That wouldn't be an issue at all really if the Alexa app wasn't so horrible. I wish Amazon would partner with Apple or something because sometimes the app just refuses to work. Sometimes the dots won't update the internet connection either. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for it, sometimes the setup works the first time, sometimes it takes 5 tries, sometimes it takes 5 tries then I have to reset my router and hard reset my phone and try 3 more times.

I received this as a Christmas gift. The device was easy to set up and link to my amazon prime account. Connecting to blue tooth for external speaker was also easy via voice set up. When asking about the weather, time and news, Alexa responds well. However, any questions such as ""what is Russia's main export"" or ""what is plantar fasiitus"" Alexa can not answer. When I ask Google voice the same questions I receive an appropriate answer. There are also skills that can be enabled but unless you ask your skills related question in the required context, Alexa can not answer. I also find it difficult to know which skill I enabled because if the skill it not enabled, Alexa will not be able to answer. I tried the bartender skill, the skill was very limited and if you didn't ask in the correct context, it could not find the amswer, could only suggest basic drinks and always suggested the same when it did. If you asked how to make a drink, more often it could not.  I guess I have look up in the app to see what is and what is not enabled to remember all the skills, not real useful? So in short works great for asking the weather, time and short news summary but I have a phone that does the same thing. I don't see the value in spending $$$ for smart devices (such as $200 for smart lock or $40 for a smart switch or $30 for a light bulb) as I would need to spend hundreds or thousands to achieve a reasonable amount of smart control over key items in the household.

After living with five of these for about a year now, I've realized some things about this system.  It's little more than some interface electronics that connects to the Alexa server.  All the real work is done by the apps and the Alexa core server routines, and that is the problem. About 99% of the apps seem to be useless, trivial junk.  Many others that promise useful functionality actually actually do very little.  The situation is worsened by virtually non-existent documentation that prevents the user from seeing the commands that are available in the app.  Alexa's language skills are also lacking, and simply reversing two words in a command can cause Alexa to get confused.  Even worse, some commands have to be phrased in a way that is simply bad English.  Guess that's a result of developing software in non-English speaking countries.  Last, many functions advertised simply don't work, such as intercom.  Following the extremely vague instructions leads to complete dead ends and with zero documentation and support, there is no solution.  Also be prepared to have the thing regularly interrupt your TV watching and conversation with weird nonsensical pronouncements.  As a cheap music streaming device it's OK, but for advanced smart home and  communications functions, be prepared for irritation and disappointment.",3.0

I told them I had tried that several times already, but it kept coming up with an error.  Gave them the error code.  On several discussion sites it stated that the error was supposedly in the registration server and that other folks had success calling into support and having the registration manually pushed through.  No such luck with me.  Finally got to someone who was going to help me get it replaced.  BUT FIRST....  You guessed it....  I had to go through all the troubleshooting steps again.  For....what?....

Honestly, it wasn't as good as I expected. About 15% of the time, it completely misunderstands you, and you'll have to continuously ask it to stop.

I've never used Google Home, but I imagine it would work better than this for simple searches. What honestly boggled my mind was the fact that it rarely even works when asking it to give you antonyms or synonyms for a word. Even when I downloaded a skill specifically designed for such tasks, the echo still very rarely heard the correct word and so spat out an incorrect definition. For antonyms, don't even bother.It works, and it's decent, but it's not as good as advertised in my opinion.

But skip the Bose. This is an updated review.  My first Echo Dot was a failure, but the replacement is good.  My full size Echo has a better sound quality, but this little guy does the job and is small enough to sit in the kitchen and not get in the way! ***UPDATE*** I purchased the Bose Soundlink Mini 2 for my Echo Dot.  The sound is OK, HOWEVER, I also own a full size Echo and that sounds BETTER than the Echo Dot with the Bose Soundlink AND for less money!  That said, if you are focused on sound quality, it is my honest opinion that you would be better served with the full size Echo over the Dot with the Bose Mini 2.Here is my initial review of the Echo:  I tried to get a video of this, but for some reason it won't load.  I'll try again later.  The dot works similar to the full size echo, although the sound quality is not as good.  The reason for two stars is that the dot frequently drops the internet connection and also seems to have a defective processing chip or something because when I leave it alone for more than half an hour and then speak to it, the response is a red ring and the comment of ""I'm having trouble understanding right now, please try again later"".  Later will only happen if I unplug it and re-plug it in again.  I called technical support, and they are sending a replacement so I'll review my replacement and  update this review as this unfolds.

Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!?

We're addicted! What a fun product! We seem to find more uses for Alexa every day. My one concern is how much money I want to spend on smart home devices now. I keep thinking how fun custom lighting might be... or how about thatSome things I do with my Alexa:- Order things on Amazon. This is both dangerous and exhilarating. I worry it might make impulse buying too easy, but so far so good. I love that I can tell her to order C batteries and they come two days later. Gone are the days of running out of a household item and forgetting to go online to re-order for days/weeks.- Play music. We got Amazon Unlimited and I got rid of my Spotify account. We have yet to find a song Alexa can't play. Sometimes you need to try a few times to remember the name of the song, but that is mostly user error.- Nighttime white noise machine. I'm a light sleeper, but I quickly realized that Alexa can soothe my sleep by playing waves or any other white noise on  Amazon Unlimited. I've created a few sleepy time playlists, and at bet time I say ""Alexa, play my sleepy time playlist on loop"" and she'll play it until I tell her to stop in the morning.- Alarm clock. Okay this one is pretty lazy, but I no longer need to push a button on my phone to ask Siri to do it.- Comic relief. She tells some funny jokes! And she has some great easter eggs. Ask her what the meaning of life, the universe and everything is.",5.0

Decided to take the plunge and get one of these now that they're down to $50, figuring I'd use it with my main stereo or with my old computer speakers, which have two inputs (one of which is already being used for my clock radio).  It arrived the day before I took a long road trip, so I decided to pack it and take it with me, along with a wifi router.  I setup the wireless network with the same SSID and password as I use at home, so I figured when I returned home the Echo would connect automatically without having to change any settings.In a dead quiet room, after a bit of training, the Echo could understand most of the commands I issued.  It does occasionally have trouble understanding me, especially when music or the alarm are playing. While it was cute being able to ask for weather forecasts or the flash briefing, they weren't particularly useful and nothing Siri on my iPhone couldn't do.  I also found the iPhone app kind of poorly laid out and unnecessarily difficult to use.My big hope with the Echo was that it would be able to playback music from my Amazon Music library, where I have tens of thousands of tracks and dozens of playlists.  Unfortunately, this hasn't gone smoothly at all.  The Echo will frequently stall, or stop playing a track right in the middle and advance to the next.  It also makes bizarre choices, preferring versions of tracks from Prime music to those in my own library.  Just earlier today I asked it to play Culture Club's ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"" and it picked a live Amazon Prime version instead of the album version from my own library.  I can't even get it to serve up a playlist in my library called simply ""Sleepytime"" - instead, the Echo keeps playing something called ""Sleepytime Pop Classics"" from Amazon Prime.The Dot has frozen up at least half a dozen times since I got it.  Earlier this evening it seemed to lose its mind while playing music and just hung, with the blue light ring pulsating.  Alexa frequently tells me she's having ""some kind of problem"" and can't respond.  I thought maybe my old cable modem / router was dying so I purchased a new one.  It's fantastic - my iPhone screams when connected to this thing - but the Echo still hangs.I have been using the Echo's alarm clock as kind of a backup to my old clock radio.  Surprisingly, it doesn't let you wakeup to a track or to a playlist, which seems like pretty basic functionality.  I was able to connect it to my Harmony unified remote, but Alexa can't do much - just turn on my receiver and TV and switch between inputs via voice command.  Hopefully more functionality will come.One thing that does work incredibly well on this device - Bluetooth.  I have a couple of Bluetooth speakers - a TDK Trek Max, which is a small portable, as well as their larger, older A73 boom box.  The older device in particular has all kinds of trouble connecting to newer Bluetooth gadgets like my iPhone - it tends to skip and drop off the network - but the Dot had no trouble connecting, sounded better than the iPhone, and never dropped the connection (unless it crashed).  It would also always reconnect successfully after a restart.  It could also communicate with both devices over a much greater distance, connecting to the Trek Max when it was in another room behind a closed door!I just wish everything else worked as well with the Dot as the Bluetooth does.I haven't given up on this thing yet.  I'm still hopeful a firmware update will cure a lot of these issues, and that more, better functionality is coming down the road.  But I probably wouldn't recommend buying one of these just yet - seems half baked.",2.0

I could hardly wait for my new toy to arrive.I had ordered the Dot about a week before it came out, and the day that I received notification that it was out for delivery, I waited with eager anticipation.I have to admit, I hate that Amazon has started using USPS more than UPS. With UPS, I'd have my package in the morning. With USPS, I don't receive it until around 4 or 5 pm. But, finally it was here and I quickly unpacked it and downloaded the app on my phone.It took a little time to set up the app, connecting Spotify, adding a code so Alexa couldn't just order anything she heard on the TV, which I'd read was a problem with earlier versions. Once I got it set up, there was an update, but that took almost no time. Then I paired it with my Bose Soundlink Mini, a ""toy"" I'd gotten this summer.Pairing was quick and easy, although one note I should mention is that if you pair several items (phone, computer, Echo Dot, etc.), you may have a problem when the speaker receives info from more than one connection. If the Dot doesn't seem to be working with the speaker, make sure that another device isn't also trying to play - even if your computer or phone is muted but would be making sound otherwise, it can claim priority on the speaker (my only complaint with the SoundLInk, but I mention it here because I thought my Dot was broken when I couldn't get it to play).For the first few days, the Dot was mostly used for music. I love being able to listen to background music when I feel like it, exactly the music I want to hear at the volume I want it, and then being able to pause or stop it when I want.But on the third day, my lights arrived. I live in an old house with weird wiring in some rooms. The overhead light in our bedroom has no switch, which makes you wonder what the people who put it in were thinking. For the first time since we bought the house, the bedroom light is actually useful. ""Alexa, turn on our bedroom light."" ""Turning on our bedroom light.""All in all, for $50, the Dot is everything I hoped it would be, and I'm still just discovering its capabilities. There are additions I'd love to see (integrating with Apple apps would be wonderful), but so far I'm very impressed, and this is a device that I know I'll be using every day.",5.0

Intelligence and voice understanding is poor. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now with Philips hue and a smart thermostat. I will leave the tech specs as they have been covered extensively here. I am a power user of Google now on my phone. Let me start by saying, echo is not even 20% of what you can do with Google now when it comes to search. It mostly interprets the sentences wrong and only gets it right about 4/10. The intelligence is really low. You have to say specific terms for it to understand at times. The services offered are themselves limited. No traffic information unless you specify your start and destination in Alexa app. Only music you can listen to is from Amazon store. The list goes on. Compared to how Google can search all over web and understands what you say almost always, this seems more like a novelty toy and not a seriously reliable assistant. Most skills really depend on how good the skills are programmed and most of them seem like half baked hasty releases. For the price it is good compared to google home but it's unreliability to understand and limited services offered makes this a novelty, not a serious buy. If Google slashes it's price in future or comes up with a cheaper no speaker version like dot, echo will have a hard time competing. I am hoping they update and improve their software soon.",2.0

Hi, this review is only about the new calling feature Amazon has recently been pushing.  Since it is the only reason these devices were purchased by me, that is all I will review. I just purchased 3 of these for family members in different states in order to take advantage of the new echo calling feature.  We all have Kindle Fires.  What Amazon doesn't tell you ahead of time (shame on Amazon, for this one) is that the calling feature will not work with a Kindle Fire.  Everyone who wants to set this feature up in a household MUST have a smart phone with the downloaded Alexa app.  Bizarre since the feature itself doesn't use plan minutes of any user, and I suppose in this day and age, most people do have smart phones.  However for families like us that do not, the echo calling feature will not work.  The echo support team says it's because all of our contacts are listed in the cell phones, but that's crap because we can manually enter our address and such.  This was a really good idea, incredibly poor execution.",1.0

Addition: Alexa has now added SiriusXM satellite radio. Between the Amazon songs, and Sirius songs, Alexa has become the center of my entertainment for music. I bought an amp, connected up Alexa and now she plays through my house. So I can say ""Alexa play Howard 100"" or ""Alexa play alternative rock"" or whatever you're in the mood for. When I ask for a specific song she almost always has it.Also, I can use my Alexa to call my parents on their Alexa. I can use my Alexa app to talk to my Alexa at home and talk to my family.So, I have updated my previous review from below to 4 stars because the have added some really cool functionality. So, if you have home automation she is a MUST. If you like music she is a great addition. You can use her as an intercom if you have a big house, I do this with my cell phone to call my family in the living room if I'm in the basement or in my bedroom. If I am trying to sleep, and the living room TV is too loud I can talk through Alexa and ask them to turn it down. You just have to try things and you'll find that she is pretty helpful.If I were to rate this on its potential alone, I would rate it 5 stars.  But there just isn't the functionality now for it to be useful for 5 stars.  It has some really cool features, and I am sure in the future it will have more.  At that point I will come back and adjust my rating to make it a better rating.For now I will tell you what I can do with it.  One cool feature is just playing music, I have it hooked up to an AMP, and into speakers in my ceiling.  I say ""Alexa play XXXX"" and the music starts.  It pretty much plays whatever I ask for, I guess it is included in a prime membership, because I am not paying for any additional service.  I have a Wink Hub 2 and Wink Relay, so I can turn on and off lights in the house, including the fireplace, with Alexa.  Let me tell you, when you say ""Alexa, turn on the fireplace"" and it lights up you get some impressed ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" from anyone watching.",4.0

First, they've added messaging.  Nobody sends us messages, but the device is constantly glowing lime green.  When asked Alexa is evasive, but users have commented she is processing messages.  This is especially annoying next to my bed.  Alexa also makes funny staticky noises.  She once woke us up with that.  The app is getting very bad response time.  I used to get my shopping list right away.  Now it can take several minutes.  Plus, the list is very primitive.  You can add and delete easily, but editing is hard and re-ordering is impossible, like to make the stuff appear in the order you'll find it in the stores.  Then, the most annoying thing is that Alexa is constantly trying to sell you something.  Do you want me to look for eggs on Amazon?  NONONO!  I'm dropping a star, though sometimes the annoyances make me think 3 stars.We were just talking about robotic servants.  Now that I have Alexa, I feel that I have an agreeable servant.  Alexa, Add peanut butter to my shopping list; play KPFA FM radio; what time is it? what's the weather?  Who's playing the Dallas Cowboys Saturday?  play Cal Tjader (I thought she'd stumble on this because of the T in his name).I have 2 Dots and an Echo.  This will sound silly, but the main attraction was the shopping list.  I have no memory, so now if I run out of something in the bathroom I can just yell, Alexa, add hand cream to my shopping list.  I had improved over the paper list by putting shopping items into Google Calendar on my phone.  But, just yelling at Alexa is such an improvement over: go get the phone; open the calendar; type or speak the items; go back to what I was doing.  So call me decadent.

The downside is that I now have to use the downstairs bathroom since she takes longer getting ready for work enjoying and using her Echo.She also just uploaded the app to allow Echo to work with her FitBit.Great product.",5.0

A few wishlist Items... Love it. As soon as these came out I bought one. I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), ""Alexa, turn off all the lights"". To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), ""OK"". Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:  -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. ""Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone"", even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)  -Calendar Events  -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. ""your front has been open for over 5 minutes"", or ""Someone just rang your doorbell"")",5.0

Good for checking traffic, weather, etc. Not nearly as good at answering general questions as Google on your phone. Great voice pickup from across the room. Easy to get some music going. It has me thinking of more ways to automate the house using Alexa.Pros:Thermostat controlGreat voice receptionNice speakerGood at tasks such as music playback.Good with specific questions such as weatherAttractive and smallCons:Poor with general questions. Didn't know how far a Kangaroo could jump when my daughter asked. Things of that nature.A battery would be nice in case you want to move it around without having it reboot. Certainly not really an issue, just a suggestion.",4.0

I received one of these as a gift.  I have to say, it took me a little time to connect it, as I frankly was OK with using Siri on my phone for most off-the-cuff requests (Siri, when was Walt Disney born?).  However, one afternoon I did set it up and I have to say for this layman (layperson?) it's a remarkably useful device.I use this primarily for two things...the first is to interact with my Amazon account, namely in adding items to my list, or ordering something when I think of it and/or I don't have a Dash button set up.  In this it works quite well, although for some things it takes some careful phrasing to get Alexa to understand me.  For instance, trying to order 3T/4T Pull Ups.  However, once I got used to some of the quirks, it works really well.The second is to interact with Amazon Music, and mainly to play certain songs on demand.  For example, I was looking at some paint chips and one of them was described as ""snow.""  Well, immediately I had to say ""Alexa, play 'Informer' by Snow.""  And it came on about two seconds later.  I especially like that I can hook the Dot into a quality speaker and properly enjoy the music.In sum, it seemed on the surface to be a frivolous kind of thing, but once I started using it I found it to be quite useful.  Frankly I still use Siri for most things that have to do with day-to-day stuff, like calendar interactions, reminders, and so on...but for general household stuff, or when I just need a quick voice-activated question answered...I find myself using the Dot more and more.My main issue with the device has to do with setup, or more properly troubleshooting.  One day the Dot just lost connectivity.  No explanation, no error code, no nothing...it just stopped working.  I spent a couple of hours trying various things until it worked again, and I really wish I knew what I did to make it work.  But yeah, I was unlinking it from my account, setting it up as brand new...everything.  No go until it suddenly started working again.  In other words, this is a Black Box (Black Disc?) in that sense.  I wish there were more visibility into the technical settings, if only so I could understand what the issues are in terms of troubleshooting other than a vague symptom.That aside, it's been working reliably since and I have to say I enjoy using it...both out of the box and after attaching several ""skills"" to it (the Food Network skill is one that's often used, for instance).  It's versatile and has the potential to become even more versatile.  I like the Dot - quite a bit.",4.0

They suggested setting up a call but, of course, that was stupid so I sent it back and ordered a replacement. I received the replacement and after some difficulty getting it set up it worked fine, including the timer, for about 1 hour. After that, it would not respond to my requests. It heard the request and apparently responded to the request as I saw in the history and the light being activated. However, there was no voice response, which renders the device rather useless. Anyhow, don't bother purchasing this device as it pretty much is a dud. Amazon needs to take a page from the Apple playbook and develop devices that are simple to use, that work, and that are reliable.Update: After sleeping overnight, the replacement Echo Dot began voice responses again, and it has been working OK now for over a week.

The first problem, is that the Amazon service keeps going down - 3 times in the last 5 days - so *nothing* that's controlled by the Echo Dot works.The second failing is that it uses Bing as it's search engine. When I ask some fairly simple questions (""Alexa, when is the next episode of The Grand Tour?""), Alexa cannot find the answer. If I use the ""OK Google"" feature on my Android phone and ask the same question, I'll almost always get the right answer... the difference between Bing and Google searches, I think. But seriously, Alexa should know everything about Amazon products, or TV shows, in the above example!I also use the Echo Dot for home automation, and it's quite fun to have Alexa turn on/off the lights in the bedroom! ...Until your Internet goes down and you have to go back to manually flipping the switch! Hasn't happened yet, but it will. I had a flaky wifi router, which my home automation products helped diagnose as the culprit to my problems. A new router... Problem disappeared.Having had the Echo Dots (4 of them) for many months now, it's extremely annoying to continally have to repeat commands in order to get Alexa to do what she's told. ""Alexa, turn off the lights""... The blue light spins for a few seconds, then goes off with no action taken and no acknowledgement of the command. Nothing in the app either. I'll try again, ""ok"" says Alexa, but the lights stay on. Maybe third time is the charm... Maybe not.And then there's the problem of them losing network connections randomly, which requires pulling the power plug.",2.0

Everything seemed fine the first day I had the Echo.  I played with the settings, changed the accent to British (American Alexa is too nasal sounding), and linked to Pandora, IHeartRadio, and Tune in.  I was surprised at how often Alexa didn't know the answer to simple questions.  She is definitely no Apple Suri.  I did find that i could not use the voice training feature.  Clicking on it did nothing.The next morning, Alexa had changed.  When I asked about the weather she gave me the info in celsius.  She would also no longer link to Pandora or IHeartRadio.  Instead she would say ""that is not available in your region.""  I checked everything (includind address) and all looked fine.  I did a factory reset but to no avail.  I then called Amazon.  I was on the phone with them for over 2 hours.  They could not find the problem.  They passed the ticket onto their web developer and said someone would call me back.  It was late so I was done for the night.The next morning I reset everything again.  Now Pandora would work but not IHeartRadio.  Still no voice training available.  I then changed Alexa's accent back to UK.  Suddenly my apps were once again ""not available in your region"" and temps were again in celsius.  This is an obvious flaw in Alexa's software.  I returned the Echo to Best Buy.  I will wait for a software upgrade before getting another one.The Amazon Serve Rep calked me two days later to say that the ticket wss still open (unsolved).  I told her that I'd returned the unit and why.  She said that their web developers were going to keep the ticket open.  I don't think this is much of a resolution.

Echo Dot or Google Home?That is the questions we all will be asking now that Google has launched their own home assistant. I Have the 1st gen Dot and now this 2nd gen.  I Have one in bedroom and another in family room and they work great together. A recent New software update makes it so only one Dot activates depending on the distance I am from it.  I Have Alexa tied into my Lutron and Lifex lights, and iHome smart plugs and Alexa works flawlessly with these devices.  I use Alexa for daily briefings of my schedule and news, get weather, find out my commute time to work, have ordered pizza through Dominos, and have activated multiple skills, which new ones are being added all the time.  Skills are written by developers and allow Alexa to perform new tasks, think of skills like an app on your phone, each app has its own function.  Alexa is not perfect, but you have to consider Amazon was the first to come out with this technology for mass market home use and for the functions it can perform it works awesome.  Very well supported by Amazon with weekly emails telling you what new skills Alexa has, and Alexa gets smarter all the time.Just recently they let developers tap into the Alexa API and we have already seen a update to have alexa work with the todolist app, which allows you to add to do's to one of the best apps out there.  Did I mention it can work with hundreds of smart home devices!  Some might be wondering if Google home that just launched might be the way to go.  I would say it really depends on your needs.  Google home will be like google now in a voice format and will tap into Google and be able to answer hundreds of questions, set timers, alarms, add to a shopping list, play music, and control Chromecast on your TV,  but will have far fewer smart home devices that work with it and set you back $129.00.  Alexa Dot will cost you $49.00 and will not be able to answer has many questions, but will tap into hundreds of smart home devices, be able to set timers, alarms, to do's, shopping lists, order Dominos pizza, give you a daily briefing of news, play music from multiple sources like Amazon Music, Pandora, and more.  To really make home assistants work well especially with smart home devices you really need more than one so you can cover your home with them. At $49.00 each it's far more economical to do this with the Dot.  I hope this review helps others to make a good decision.",5.0

I've received this device as a corporate gift, and glad i didn't pay any money for it. While its ability to recognize my voice is quite outstanding (despite my heavy accent) and it can hear me from pretty much anywhere in the room, thats where the good things end. ""Alexa, what are the nearest McDonalds hours?"" No info (which  Google map has). ""Alexa, play Eco 99fm on tunein"" - no way in the world i was able to make it recognize the station name (eco, not echo, not equal, etc), while there is no way to activate favorites by voice. It can play a tunein station, it can set an alarm, but it can't set a radio alarm, or even set a user provided alarm sound. Speaking about alarms, it has no internal backup battery, not even a small one. It will keep the alarms, but if the power is out during the alarm time you are probably out of luck. It supports custom plugins (called ""skills"") i have yet to try coding one, but ones already there are all activated using an awkward ""Alexa, ask <plugin name> to <plugin command> or by ""Alexa, open <plugin name>"", which then drives the dialog on its own. So, for example, to activate the nighlight plugin, you have to say ""Alexa, ask nighlight to turn on"", which is awkward and unnatural. This is a bad example, and a nightlight plugin is merely a hack, but it seems to apply to all ""skills"", of which none seems to be very useful to me. I have yet tl try the smart home stuff, but apparently, very few devices currently work with Alexa. BTW, try explicitly asking it to search on Google (Alexa, search Google...) and it will tell you it doesn't do that, promising you to search the answers on...

Few drawbacks, though. I'm not a big tech junkie, but every now and again, certain tech items just seem ""right"" for me.  That was the case when I first heard of the Echo.  I researched extensively before deciding to purchase the Dot instead of the full size.  The only difference so far as I can tell is that the full size has a higher quality speaker, and since I'm not one to be overly concerned about sound quality, and don't like loud music, I decided to try this one.As for the speaker quality, it is far better than I expected.  All of the descriptions, articles, and reviews I read indicated that everyone with a Dot would have to connect it to a separate speaker.  If you like loud music, or are extremely concerned with a high sound quality, I suppose that's true.  But, after receiving my Dot yesterday, I don't necessarily agree.I expected to get about the same amount of sound out of this little gadget as I do from my Fire tablet.  Whoa!  It is so much more than that!  Now again, I know folks who like their music loud, and for that segment of the population, you'll want the external speaker.  I prefer music to be either mid-grade or soft background sound, and this more than does the trick.  I currently have it in a 180 sq ft room, and I personally cannot handle having it turned up to 10 (loudest setting) while in the same room.  My home is around 1300 sq ft, and with the Echo Dot on one end of the house, I can hear it at 10, though faintly, from the opposite end.  It's a long ranch house, so you get the idea I hope.Another positive is that setup was amazingly simple.  I'd received my Wemo plugs the day before, and they were a nightmare to set up - barely any instructions, and tech support was very difficult to reach.  But that's a separate review.  In any case, I was terrified I'd be spending several more hours trying to get this little thing set up, but quite the opposite.  Within about 5 minutes of removing it from the package, it was set up and linked to my Wemo switches!  Super easy, and not only simple but good instructions.Now on to the cons I've found so far.  First, despite what Amazon says, when the music is turned up, the microphones sometimes do not hear you speaking to it unless you shout.  That seems to be intermittent, though.I've added several ""skills"", and many of them have bugs or just don't work at all.  The one that I would find very enjoyable except that it doesn't work well is the Word Master game.  Alexa does not understand many of the words I say, and despite repeating them over and over again, I often have to just pick a different word.  I had the same issue with the Quick Event skill to add items to my calendar.  For some reason, she would not understand the word ""Thursday"" - although outside of this skill has no trouble with that word in general.I would also like to see a software update where you can spell a word if she does not understand, and then you can ensure it's accurate - especially when trying to add something to your calendar.My other complaint is that while Echo Dot is playing music, my Fire tablet which is linked to this device keeps its screen lit up.  I usually only have to charge my Fire once or twice per week, and yesterday went through around 80% of a full charge.  You can turn the display off on the tablet manually, but then as soon as you speak to Alexa again, it lights back up and you'd have to keep turning it off manually - which sort of defeats the purpose of having an Echo you can talk to!  I'd really love to see Amazon fix that, because I don't like the idea of draining the battery so fast all of the time and wearing it out faster than necessary.After using it for a little while yesterday, I decided to go ahead and purchase a Sensi smart thermostat to use with it.  I will be buying other Smart Home gadgets to connect with this a little at a time.  And, I may decide to purchase a second Dot for use in my studio at the other end of my home.  All in all, I'm quite happy with this new little toy, aside from the few things I've mentioned.  I will add updates as any other issues or benefits arise!",4.0

I have had my echo dot for 4 days now. I am impressed with the speakers and how far it is picking up my voice. However, within the Alexa app, I am a bit disappointed. Alexa relies on her skills that you must memorize in order for them to work. Every skill you enable you need to be certain you state its trigger word for Alexa to know what to do. Not a good idea if you have 100s of skills. There are a lot of skills you must enable for Alexa for her to work. Right now Alexa can do just handful of things and has a lot of room for improvement.Suggestions to developers:-Enable SMS messaging-Ask Alexa to make a phone call-Have Alexa know certain facts about you or someone and store them in her memory, not just a to do list- Ask Alexa if it is a good day to play outside and then she can say yes depending on the weather- Ask Alexa if I have a dentist appointment coming up.

I don't get it the echo doesn't do anything that you can't do with your smart phone or your tablet now if you have a smart home  maybe but everything is controlled by an app that's on your phone or your tablet and all the smart devices out there and they have their own app  that's what I don't get it . I'm not saying it's horrible device is actually cool especially if you get multiples for a smart home  but other than that the set up for her to do the fun stuff is cumbersome and you have to remember the verbiage that you have to use so the device will function properly  Way too much effort something like this if it's cloud-based it should have the information I'm on my second hour of selecting it's intelligence So in conclusion the echoes cool but this more fun well it's different but again I'm going to keep it a little longer to see if I can find a purpose for it,the kitchen  seems to be the best place it does have recipes and it will walk you through one that I did get it to do but other than recipes news and weather everything else takes effort to set up.when you see it on TV and the persons requesting it to do something it does it what nobody tells you is you have to set all that up  Alexa doesn't know everything you have to enable it to know what you want to know. So this is not a work out of the box device other assistance work,you ask it a question you asked to do something it does it no set up required this has to be connected to every  Single thing it does  and you need Amazon prime music or Spotify premium not regular Spotify so there's some expense that goes along with it as well . The biggest pro is  at $39 it cost as much is a good alarm clock and that is what this is a great alarm clock with good features  and it does sound bad so you do need a Bluetooth speaker if you want quality music Altogether this  isn't a bad review it's just do you need it or do you want it I bought it because I wanted it  and now that I have it just don't get it.",3.0

I received my Dot as a gift, as I have been interested in these kinds of devices for a while now.  While this device is the least expensive entry point for a smart-home hub and music player, it is surprisingly disappointing when compared to its direct competitor.Pros:-Inexpensive-Small and out of the way-'Alexa' is much easier to say than 'ok google'-Aux out port for plugging in your own speakers-Cool light ring that is easy to see from any directionCons:-Does not include a 'full' music service like Google Home (Which includes 6 months of YouTube Red)-Fails to find relevant playlists a huge percent of the time.  The Home easily finds playlists for 'dinner music' or 'late night music.'  The Dot/Alexa often can't find anything, or asks you to upgrade to a premium music service.-You cannot create full custom commands with IFTTT.  Instead, all custom commands must start with 'trigger,' which not only takes all of the fun out if it, but it disrupts the way you're used to interacting with your device.-Commands don't work conversationally, IE you must state the subject every time you ask a new question.-Can't have complex commands that send spoken words or numbers to other devices and services.It's hard not to compare the Echo to the Google Home.  If you can manage to tolerate the higher price tag, and are already tied into the Google echosystem, there is no doubt in my mind that the Home is a much better device.If you are computer-literate and interested in creating your own commands, the Home is the way to go.  If you don't ever plan to customize your device and you already have Amazon's premium music service, the Dot isn't a bad deal.  It's just a bit disappointing that Amazon's huge head-start doesn't yield a better product.",2.0

I like the fact that I can verbally control Amazon Music or Play or Pause my Firestick.But in regards to the rest of its operating features I’m very disappointed in the overall method of the way the Echo Dot known as Alexa, Dot or Computer functions.I want a device I can just speak to, it’s very frustrating for me as a user that suffers from short term memory loss to try an recall all the specific  key words needed to be spoken in order to activate the attached modules.So if I’m having trouble recalling the key words to activate a peticular module, at that point the Dot is useless to me. The Dot has a lot of Modules/Services that can be attached to Alexa but again in order for me to use the module I have to speak the exact selected key words.So the only way this would be of value to me is to create a file and print it to be able to have the full use of Alexa.This is why I will always choose Siri or Cortona over Alexa. I like the idea of being able to speak and for the most part have more of a natural conversation with the AI’s.I have looked at a lot of the modules made available to operate in conjunction with Alexa, but again it just does me no good if I can’t recall the long list of key words needed to activate the 1000’s of modules.When Amazon gets away from all the exact key words that are a must or changes Alexa to have more of a natural conversation ability I will change my rating.The over all concept is very exciting, but it saddens me to only have a very, very limited use of the Echo Dot as a result of the mandatory key word use.",1.0

I've kept my eye on the Amazon Echo ever since it came out.  However, for a person that owns a home, it only makes sense that you would want one in almost every room.  Buying a handful of Echos at $180 would have been too much of an investment for me.  So I sat and waiting for a better solution.  Then this new 2nd Generation Echo Dot came out for $50.  This was more of the solution I was looking for, so I purchased several of them.Installing them and setting them up was a  breeze.  The clarity/quality of the internal speaker really surprised me.  I wasn't expecting that kind of sound from such a small package.  Also, if you have a couple of rooms where you want even better sound, you can just plug in a couple of amplified stereo speakers (I will most likely do this in my living room).I have Samsung Smartthings Hub (for home automation) and Logitech Harmony Hub (for video/audio automation), so my ultimate goal was to be able to walk through my home; turning on/off lights as I enter/exit rooms simply by speaking a simple command.  I also wanted to be able to just speak to control my TV, Roku & Amp.  This new Echo Dot does this flawlessly.  Though I've only had these installed for about a week, they have performed admirably and help to complete my home automation project.The Dot has several internal microphones.  These microphones are very sensitive.  If the room is quiet, I can almost whisper from across a 20' room and the Dot will accurately receive what I said.  If there are other audio sources playing at the time (like a loud TV), you do need to speak up, so that the Dot can recognize that you are trying to communicate with it, and that it isn't just the TV.  This is to be expected, and short of the Dot having a camera that constantly has it's eye on you to visually recognize a command spoken to it, you will need to speak a little louder than the other sources playing.The Echo has many application add-ins known as 'skills' that you can add.  There are over 1,000 of them, and that list continues to grow.  However, many people don't know that a lot of power is added to the Echo by use of IFTTT.com.  Until Echo gets a Logitech Harmony skill, you will need to use IFTTT to control the Logitech Harmony from an Echo.I also like the size of the Dot.  I wanted small devices that I could add to my rooms and hide, so that no one would know where the voice was coming from.  This not only makes the room more aesthetically pleasing, but guests are always trying to figure out where Alexa's voice is coming from.  It makes your smart home just a little bit cooler.There are many fun things you can do with the Echo.  You can add games to it, have it look up movie trivia, local business information, give you the time, add wake up alarms, set timers, etc...  This said, for $50, this is just about the highest value in electronic devices you can buy.  Besides it being a great value though, the Amazon Echo Dot also makes your life easier.",5.0

The human interface is built around a smart phone, which not everyone owns. Also, the iPhone app requires IOS 8 or higher, so it does not work with my iPhone 4S, which only supports IOS 7. Too many companies like Amazon and Apple forget that some of us have older devices and don't want to spend a wad on new phones if the one we have works. This really annoys me.Note - Amazon does have a web interface for your PC, but they don't advertise this. I have to dig through the support pages to find this.The whole concept of this device scares me. It is connected to the internet and listens and records all of the time, not just when you talk to it. With all the cyber security flaws and hacks happening, I believe that you can kiss your privacy goodby. There's already a law enforcement action against Amazon to release recordings.When a data breach does occur, the public is not notified until months or years later.

""Alexa, go *&!$ yourself"" is usually where I end up after a few minutes arguing with Alexa to perform some basic task I've asked her to do many MANY times before. This time, however, she doesn't under stand what ""living room lights"" are. She responded accurately to that request, ""That's not very nice!"" Since she can take and understand an insult, I feel comfortable anthropomorphize her, and will there for continue to refer to Alexa as a ""her"".Anecdotes aside, here is the quick and dirty on Alexa (Dot or Echo, as I own many of both).Alexa responds very well to commands. When she responds, she understands most commands the first time. ""When"" she responds, ""most commands"" and ""first time"" are the problems. Periodically she simply ignores me. Her little lights flicker, showing she hears me, yet the eventually dim as I speak, or a few seconds after I finish speaking. This happens in loud or pen-drop quite rooms. I don't know what causes it. I've tried resetting her, this works some times, but not all the time. I've tried sleeping on it, and she ends up working fine in the next day and for a while. I don't consider this acceptable. I've lights, thermostats, and other devices connected to her, I've abandoned remotes and the idea of finding switches on plugs, or the inconvenience of  getting out of bed to turn off the bedroom lights. I'm committed to this automation process; be it Alexa, Google, or whatever frustrates me the least.""Most commands"" is the next problem. Alexa can do a lot of things, but simply not enough things, and with less variety than we require. Devices and software works well when we know what we must do to get it to respond the way we want. While I'm impressed with the variety of ways I can tell Alexa change the volume on her music, ask her some basic question, or tell her to go #$!@ herself, I'm still more than disappointed with the simple stuff that requires -I- learn her commands, rather than her know mine. Friends and family must be instructed on many of the commands, and I dislike having to keep a cheat sheet on how to turn on my kitchen lights.She does respond correctly MOST of the time, the ""first time"", however, if I forget which sentences work or what something is called, she simply doesn't have a clue. I don't expect perfection, and in the regard she does hit the mark more than miss, but, well, just look up that video of the kid asking to play a game with her and getting a list of pornographic positions... I've not experienced that harsh a misunderstanding, but enough to make you giggle... but only the first time.The devices Alexa can control is a VERY short list; this is one of the biggest reasons to avoid getting one of these novelties. It's novel to turn on and off lights (though expensive for an entire house), it's nice that I can play music (though only that which I have on Amazon Music), and control the thermostat (though, as I write this, to the command, ""Alexa, set thermostat to 74"", I get ""Sorry, that device is not responding to commands"" - since it responds to the Honeywell App on my phone, I assume it's her fault; I am troubleshooting it between paragraphs). Alexa still can't control my PS4 or XBox One, nor my 55"" Panasonic TV, nor can she do a thing with my computers. I am able to control all of these using various other devices. Simple not with Alexa alone, and this is a Lord of the Rings kind of situation... There must be ""One voice controller to rule them all,"" for voice control to be successful. Voice control is the universal remove of the future.Price wise echo hits the spot. Though, I was definitely not a part of the ""buy 5 get one free"". I'm, not sure what mansion Amazon things I live in, or if they think I will start stuffing them in stockings or under trees at Christmas; I now own 3 total devices. And how the interact among themselves is not something for Amazon to be proud of...Today, while talking with my roommate in the living room, I hear Alexa talking to no-one-in-particular, about 3 yards away in the kitchen. Clearly, since the house is quite except for our conversation, the kitchen Alexa though she heard her name, while the living Alexa not 3 feet away, remained silent and obedient. ""What WHAT!?"" While her shared algorithm failed in one place an not the other, who can know? It kind of makes sense that distance, and reverberation might have changed what was said _just enough_ for it to sound like ""Alexa"" in the other room... but again, hardly a success. This hasn't happened often, and even better, usually the closest Alexa responds, however, even when this works, they are three people and not one...Each Alexa has their own alarms, and song playback history. They are different and unique, and this is bad! Here is what my voice controller MUST do: It must know what room it's in, even if I must tell it, ONCE. It must let me tell it where devices are, which rooms, which house... I should be able to tell it to ""turn off all living room lights"". It should know I have _lights_ in a room called _livingroom_, and be able to control all with minimal setup and fuss. While I can add groups in Alexa to do this, it's tedious, and disappointing. And more to the point, this lack of software capability explains why I can vace ""Alexa, play my 90s playlist"" in the living room, then walk to the bedroom and tell the bedroom ""Alexa, resume my music here"". Additionally, it would be a bonus if Alexa could either recognize who I am by voice, or _at least_ let me reference the activities of other devices by location, ""Alexa, transfer music from living room"" while I'm in the bedroom.I have read up on other devices that can interact with Alexa, but I'm not going to consider the need for super expensive stuff to enable controlling a device as a ""success"". The future in universal remote voice control is approach-ability; if it's prohibitively expensive, far too expensive for what you actually get (such as the expensive Logitech device I'd need to control my TV at the moment; well except by using my PS or XBX directly). And finally, the ability for the average person to setup and control anything with Alexa without the need for a degree in computer science.The summary to this all...While Alexa, Echo and Echo Dot are impressive and useful, I have not committed to Amazon as the supplier for the voice control I've been desiring since the first time I watched Startrek The Next Generation. I gave Alexa this much time, and money, and got this far because Amazon is a company I tend to trust for quality and not to abandon their efforts. They seem to do things ""the right way"" and ""all the way"" enough of the time that I don't mind committing, after some deliberation, to what ever technologies they offer. However, as it stands, I am concerned with the lack of high impact progress with Alexa and Echo, besides the ability to order stuff from Amazon. I am still hoping to see some improvements in the next couple of months (as promised when this product first arrived) to substantially increase the stars on this review. However, with two stars I am saying there is promise, but I am anticipating finding another vendor and boxing up all of these Amazon Dots, and putting them in the basement next to the VCR, Xbox Connect, and pottery wheel. Please Amazon, don't disappoint me.",2.0

My girlfriend was interested in one of these so I ordered the echo dot for her for xmas. Shipping was quick and easy.About the dot.....well put it like it.....it's basically a hub for the home. Alone it doesn't do much other than a few jokes, and answering a few questions. We got rather bored with it until we started searching for ""skills"" for it. After finding some skills it made it a little more enjoyable. It's kind of overwhelming to look at all the skills and then to remember each skills phrase to use that skill. It's basically like the amazon app store and you have a billion skills to teach it and then try to remember all the phrases.  It would be much better if you could add these skills and then Alexa learned them and you didn't need a specific phrase that activate that skill.

Cool device, not worth $50, I had a gift card for $20, it IS worth $30 plus tax. Amazon needs to step up the game on Alexa - when it works, it works, but much dumber than other AI assistants like Siri or Cortana, and ZERO sense of humor or personality. The skills are cumbersome, music playing support only works well with Amazon music unless you are streaming to it as a bluetooth speaker - which is dumb, as the speaker is not loud enough to hear over an air conditioner.The Alexa platform is VERY open - which is cool BUT it means the available ""Skills"" are mostly very poor quality. For some reason the white Dot still comes with a black power cord, which is just more lack of attention to detail on Amazon's part. Sloppy, sloppy.This is a must-have if you use any home automation - although the setup is VERY CLUNKY - expect hours of set up to get it just right if you want to change light colors or do anything more complex than switching smart devices on or off. There's a terrible interface for adding and forgetting devices in the companion ""app"" -I use the term ""app"" VERY loosely - it's more of a sloppy wrapper on a webpage. Integrating with iOS is spotty at best without lots of workarounds and IFFFT recipes - pretty much essential - and theres no way to program custom words or commands beyond meager smart home groups and Stringify/IFFFT services. Alarms, timers, schedules - all poorly implemented - no way to have Alexa automatically announce reminders or alarms, just one ring tone that is set for all alerts. Commands have very little context and must be given one at a time - no way to say ""Alexa, dim my main lights and turn on the kitchen lights"" - she will just complain that she doesn't understand, or just ignore the command entirely.HOWEVER - despite all these drawbacks I think they will EVENTUALY be ironed out. It's still a cool addition to a geeky home setup and with lots and lots of customization (and maybe even scripting one's own skills) it can be more useful than annoying.Seriously though, Amazon - hurry up.",3.0

Very disappointed. I had great expectations for this device, as i was going to base my whole home automation on several of these devices however the following issues forced my to return it:1. Horrible Mic pick up. This is suppose to be the strong point of this device. Audio recognition for several people in my household was horrible. At 10 feet it was non existent. in other words, Echo would not even respond. Even after several session of ""voice training"", it still was terrible.2. Home automation linking with other devices has alot of ""growing up"" to do. The application on echo as well as the various drivers are very immature. I had difficulty pairing up to Z wave devices even though i was using a smart things hub (which is whole another disaster ...). very frustrating and unrewarding experience.3. Constant drop outs. Echo would loose internet connection when no issues existed. Mysteriously, echo would periodically loose internet connection and have to either be manually re-booted and initialize on it one. Very annoying !4. Alexa would start talking on her own, un-commanded. seems that she would repeat the last flash news or last music she was performing before being told to stop. then within an hour or so she would start up on her own.Please note that i have a 50 MB Fiber optic Internet service and run dual routers with 2.4 and 5 Ghz coverage in my house.I really wanted to like this device and build up my home automation.

Now. I was looking forward to getting into the Amazon Echo - Dot experience.  Started with the Echo, which I immediately fell in love with.  Now, bad on my part that I took some info on face value and did not research enough to know that what I expected isn't completely available.  First, I sincerely thought all devices hooked together and therefore having the main Echo would have synchronicity to the Dot or visa versa.  Looking at the visual posted, it seemed if you had a device in different areas and it would work like a wireless speaker system. I have exactly this from an older Sony system and so it didn't seem unreasonable to expect it from the Echo and Dot.Bottom line - the syncing audio capability between devices is not available - YET.  It looks as though it may well be available sometime in the future as well as connecting to the Fire Stick voice control so hopefully that'll come soon.  It does have some super awesome features and for the price (less than some blue tooth speakers I've bought), it is certainly worth the price.  I only give 3 stars because of the love / hate thing I have going.  No one's fault but my own for not completely checking it out and seeing if it would do what I expected.",3.0

I received this as a gift and due to who gave it to me, I wanted to like it. But there is very little that it helps me do that I can't do elsewhere...PROs: - It makes use of my Amazon Prime Music stations. This is the only reason why I have any interest in keeping it. I really like Amazon Prime Music (six stars) and this is the best stand alone streaming device when I am at home (as long as I keep it on one station).- ""Alexa! Tell me a joke."" and other easter eggs. It can be a good source for party tricks.- Other PROs? Ummmm, I can't think of one at the moment.CONs: - You have to speak everything. That's the only functional interface.- You have to spend more time thinking about how to phrase your command than it takes to click through menus on an app for other devices.- It doesn't work very much like Hal (another easter egg, by the way). I can recognize your speech pretty well, but it can't interpret the thought in your spoken words very well. I cannot imagine ordering products this way without having visual feedback about what I ordered.- If your spoken command was interpreted incorrectly you waste even more time.- The Android app is virtually useless. You have almost no control over the Dot via the app, other than showing you what you've done. Plus, the app takes FOREVER to load. Maybe I get if I open after restarting my phone and opening the Alexa app the first time. But if I just hop over to another app, send a message or take a call, it seems to back to step one.- It's not wireless. It needs a power cord plugged into the wall to operate. It would be nice to have a battery so I can take Alexa around the house with me.- It looses Bluetooth paring with my speakers almost every day. You can't just go through paring to find the device. You have to forget paring and re-pair (which requires menus on two devices, really three when you consider the Alexa menu is on an app).In short, as long as I can play one of my favorite music stations, it stays, otherwise it will go into the closet which would be a big disappointment to the person who gifted this to me if they ever find out.- Knowing that Alexa is ALWAYS listening is kind of creepy. This causes you to mute the microphone taking away the advantage of calling out ""Alexa!"" arbitrarily.",2.0

Now on my 2nd Echo DOT since December 2016. The 1st one died in 3 months and I did not buy the insurance on it. I contacted Amazon and they said they'd send me another echo for $49 which I totally balked at. I told them it didn't make sense for me to spend $49 for another one when the first one didn't even last three months!  After much discussion an Amazon customer service supervisor agreed to send me a replacement at no charge. Kudos to Amazon for standing up for what's right.,3.0

Software glitch makes the ECHO DOT a worthless purchase!!!. I would give this less than One Star if that were possible.  I have owned my 2nd Generation Echo Dot for ten months.  Two months ago, I noticed that the Dot was having problems maintaining its internet connection, which is a problem as I use it primarily to control Wemo switches for lamps around my home.  It became very unreliable.  What's worse is that, after it loses its internet connection, it does not automatically reconnect.  You must go through the entire set up procedure.  This makes the Echo Dot completely worthless.  I have tried all troubleshooting solutions offered by Amazon and by online communities.  I have just spent 45 minutes online with Amazon technical support.  Their conclusion was that ""electronic devices often have problems"" and that I should just purchase another Echo Dot.  They offered me a $17 discount to purchase a new one.  They could not understand that I did not want to purchase another electronic device that has this problem.  According to the internet, the problem is not specific to my device.  Many Echo Dot customers are experiencing the same failures.  It seems as if it is a software glitch.  I already own another Echo Dot and expect it to experience the same problem shortly, so why would I want to buy yet another.  I am a great fan of the tall Echo and have not experienced this problem with any of the three I own.  But the Echo Dot is a waste of your money until this glitch is resolved.",1.0

I'd like to give a better review, since I was an early adopter of the Echo, and on the whole, it's been a net benefit. But I can't. Something has recently screwed up the way Alexa responds, and I suspect it's on Amazon's end. Alexa is less able to answer questions than either Google or Siri, it consistently gets music selections wrong, can't find music or audiobooks that are in my library, and drops wi-fi unexpectedly and without cause. These problems are all recent, and seem to rise from a pushed update.It's nice to have the Echo Dot to extend the Echo's usefulness throughout the house.

Something very strange is up with these Echo Dots and my router. I don't know what, exactly, but I think there is a bug in their baseband software/firmware. I've had multiple calls with tech support and the issue has supposedly been escalated to development but I have not reached any sort of resolution and have already been through 3 replacement dots (and all of them exhibit the same issue on my network).The array of problems varies from:1) ""Sorry your Echo Dot has lost its connection""2) ""Sorry I was having trouble understanding that. Please try again later""3) Echo Dot wakes upon ""Alexa"" but does not process or recognize my queries (this can be verified by going into the Alexa App/Settings/History and seeing ""Text not available. Click to play recording."") - the blue ring and cyan directional mic-light stay lit as if Alexa keeps wanting to listen (this is with no background noise).4) Echo Dot takes more than a couple seconds to actually process any command5) Echo Dot will respond but the response will sometimes be cut-off halfway through.This is all very strange because I've tried putting these Dots on my iphone hotspot network as well as using a different router and they seem to not have these issues, for the most part. I've also gone through all the troubleshooting steps (factory reset the Dots, put them on different networks, turn off firewall, open ports, factory reset router, etc etc etc). I would tend to blame it on the router at this point, but the kicker is that I have an original Echo on this very  network and it has ZERO issues. So therein lies the issue - If the original Echo works fine, my router can't be the culprit here - obviously there are design/hardware/software differences between the Echo and Echo Dots, and that is why I'm guessing there is a bug with the Echo Dot baseband software/firmware. At some point through communication with tech support, it was even acknowledged that there is some known issue regarding Dots losing their connectivity. I'm just surprised this isn't as widespread, but perhaps it only manifests itself in certain environments where specific routers are used. Either way, I can't sit around and wait for development with zero updates to the problem. It seems like it is just being swept under the rug. BTW: yes, my firmware updates have been applied to both units. Perhaps I will ask if they can roll the firmware back to what it was initially, and block upgrades, to see if there is any difference. I noticed, before the units upgraded, that they were fairly responsive. But then again, the upgrades occurred several minutes after the initial setup, which didn't give much time to tell if they would be 'stable'I am running DDWRT on a Netgear Nighthawk X4 (r7500v2). But I have seen another, on Reddit, reporting the same exact issues as myself and he is running a TP-Link Archer C8. I'd be curious to know what routers, those of you running into this problem, are using in your environments. I think I've reached the end of the road here - I will probably need to send these units back for a refund, sadly.UPDATE 11/3/16: I ended up resetting my router to factory defaults and upgraded to the latest DDWRT image as well. Still no luck with the Dots maintaining a connection. This is a very strange problem all the while my original Echo continues to work flawlessly. This points back to bugs and issues with the Echo Dots, whether it's hardware or software/firmware. I reached out to tech support again and asked for any updates or follow-up to no avail. The tech support rep was at least very helpful and understanding. Seeing that there was no resolution in sight, I asked what they would do and he offered a refund for *both* Dots (even though I got one at Best Buy... in reality the refund was for my order of the Echo Dot + Philips Hue bundle I pre-ordered at $99.xx in prior months). Additionally, he offered me a $30 promo credit and then told me to go ahead and keep the Dots. GREAT customer service! But it still doesn't excuse the fact that something is inherently wrong with these units. I consider these kinds of bugs to be ticking time bombs - if they leave these ""minor"" issues unresolved, who knows what impact there will be as they release more and more updates. I envision there will, slowly, be an increase in the number of support cases revolving around connectivity issues with these Echo Dots. 1-star added because of the experience with Amazon support, but in reality this review is still about the Echo Dot product.UPDATE 12/20/16: Several weeks ago I saw an updated post on Reddit from another user who was experiencing the same issues I did and clued me in on something - create another network/guest network, use WPA (rather than WPA2) and hide the SSID. Not the optimal solution as far as security is concerned but I gave it a shot and the last two Echos I was having major issues with started working flawlessly and have been working ever since. So there is a very OBVIOUS defect/issue with the way these Echo Dots negotiating and maintaining connecting via the WPA2 protocol. To my knowledge, Amazon has neither confirmed or addressed this issue at large. It's hard to believe a majority of users out there are *not* using WPA2 but I guess I wouldn't be surprised either. Perhaps this still is only limited to specific hardware when WPA2 is in use but I've reproduced the issue on my dad's network which was also secured with WPA2 and an AC router.",2.0

I don't get it the echo doesn't do anything that you can't do with your smart phone or your tablet now if you have a smart home  maybe but everything is controlled by an app that's on your phone or your tablet and all the smart devices out there and they have their own app  that's what I don't get it . I'm not saying it's horrible device is actually cool especially if you get multiples for a smart home  but other than that the set up for her to do the fun stuff is cumbersome and you have to remember the verbiage that you have to use so the device will function properly  Way too much effort something like this if it's cloud-based it should have the information I'm on my second hour of selecting it's intelligence So in conclusion the echoes cool but this more fun well it's different but again I'm going to keep it a little longer to see if I can find a purpose for it,the kitchen  seems to be the best place it does have recipes and it will walk you through one that I did get it to do but other than recipes news and weather everything else takes effort to set up.when you see it on TV and the persons requesting it to do something it does it what nobody tells you is you have to set all that up  Alexa doesn't know everything you have to enable it to know what you want to know. So this is not a work out of the box device other assistance work,you ask it a question you asked to do something it does it no set up required this has to be connected to every  Single thing it does  and you need Amazon prime music or Spotify premium not regular Spotify so there's some expense that goes along with it as well . The biggest pro is  at $39 it cost as much is a good alarm clock and that is what this is a great alarm clock with good features  and it does sound bad so you do need a Bluetooth speaker if you want quality music Altogether this  isn't a bad review it's just do you need it or do you want it I bought it because I wanted it  and now that I have it just don't get it.",3.0

It's a complicated relationship. Waiting for Dot to be delivered was something I may have become too excited for. It's price point is great for a college student who is on a tight budget. However, many of its features are geared more towards those who have the means to purchase home automation supplies and make necessary changes to their homes. Alexa does a great job in controling a TP-Link Smart plug, and I have yet to try other devices (again, college student) but it is fairly easy to set up smart home skills. However, when it come to usability as an assistant, Alexa could use many major improvments in its capabilities. Its customizability is still poor. Alexa has a hard time to answer questions that are moderately complex (Things Google Now can do). A huge pitfall in Alexa is the lack of integration with Google. As someone who has much of their lives on Google, it would be nice to see an update that allowed for the use of Google apps, especially Play Music. I got this to see what it could do and while Alexa has support for major brands, she is not smart enough yet to attempt to find answers that are not preprogrammed. The search engine Alexa uses is Bing and that is quite sad. I would hope to be able to customize which search engine I use but oh well. In terms of understanding my commands, Alexa does a great job of deciphering what I have said...if she hears it. Waking Alexa up requires a little more volume in voice, but unfortunately it makes it awkward around other people. I hope that they roll out more updates, making alexa more useful for Q&A and integration with more services. Amazon should stop competing with Google and instead integrate. Lastly, it does get annoying when the response to not understanding a question is the same over and over again. At this point, I would prefer a subtle ""huh"" instead of ""hmm. i don't think i understood the question I heard"". I'll keep her but not ready to fully depend on her. It's complicated.",3.0

Just purchased still new at using it. preliminary review is that it is a Money maker for Amazon. I have a personal music library of over 12000 songs on a pogoplug personal cloud drive. I also have a Google drive subscription, however I can not access either, the only way to listen to my music library is to upload it to Amazon cloud service for $7.99 a month with a prime membership, $9.99 for non prime. You can upload 250 songs for free. You also have to purchase another $9.99 membership to their music service. It does read you your downloaded books, but in such a monotone voice, you will fall asleep. Will not let me listen to YouTube for music, will not connect to my Samsung smart TV. Does not work with my craftsman garage door opener.  Does work with my WeMo and I home devices nicely though. Has a hard time answering follow-up questions. If you tell Alexa to turn on the lights at a certain time it only sets a reminder in the Alexa app. I told her to remind me to do something in 20  minutes, and again only placed an entry in my Alexa app without alert at set time.  Still learning though so I will edit as I get to know Alexa better.  The speaker is actually very nice, and can hear you from a good distance. Would be nice if it would let you know that it is ready upon the wake up command. If you are not looking at it, or are in an adjoining room, and say Alexa, you do not know if it heard you or if it is ready.",2.0

Lots of potential here, but there's a ways to go, and some improvements that could be made to the design.The rubber backing, and the fact that the cables plug in near the + button make wall mounting problematic. Adhesives don't stick to the rubber backing (or I'm afraid they'll ruin the rubber or become permanent) so you're stick with a mounting bracket. And when on the wall, the dot is upside down so that the USB cable can hang off the bottom. Not sure if that affects the mic performance (probably not) but it's one of those little quirks that can be annoying.  A proper, permanent wall mount and a way to hide the wires would be huge and could turn this into a staple fixture for smart homes.Fro the integration, I love that there is support for Harmony and for Insteon. I'm getting closer and closer to whole house automation. But the problems I have are:*Support for multiple users is pretty terrible (on the surface it's fine, until you try to do something like play Spotify while not on your main Alexa account)*On a related note, it seems like the AI should be able to at least attempt to identify voices to tie people to specific profiles*Sometimes I'd like to issue commands from my phone, so as to no t wake up my wife by talking to Alexa in the middle of the night*Sometimes Alexa just doesn't understand what you're saying, even when it's a command you use all the time and has always worked before and there's no ambient noise to blame. It works just well enough to make you let down your guard and be extremely annoyed when it happens again.*The bluetooth speaker connection isn't always smooth or obvious that it's connected and working. It'd be nice if the app showed the bluetooth connection status and allowed you to connect/disconnect known devices from there. In fact it might be there but it's buried in menus a bit.*I wish that Alexa was not so tied in to other Amazon services. I don't care about Prime music streaming, and there's lots of advertising and hooks to get you to buy more Amazon stuff. Stop it, I'm already a customer and a fan - you're being too clingy, Alexa. I'd be willing to pay more for a device that isn't so biased toward selling a particular brand, but unfortunately I don't have much hope for HomeKit or Google Home to do any better. Maybe IFTTT can make their own AI and hardware and it will solve this problem.",3.0

Some of my favorite things right now are playing music, setting wake up alarm, playing rain sounds to go to sleep by, asking for the weather or latest headlines.  The Dot has a shopping list and to do list, but I needed multiple shopping lists.  The problem was solved by enabling the Our Groceries app on the Dot and putting the app on my phone.  Now, as I go about my day and think of something I need, I don't have to go write it down on a list.  I simply say Alexa, ask Our Groceries to add milk to Walmart or add paper towels to Sams.  When I go shopping, the list is on my phone and as I shop, I tap the item and it is crossed off on my list.  If I ask for something that I've already added, Alexa tells me it is already on my list.  My only disappointment is that it can't Google things.  It can read things from Wikipedia, but that's about it. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume from the Dot.  I have not yet had to use it at full volume.  It is quite loud. Overall I am pleased with the purchase and have ordered a second one so I don't have to keep taking it from the kitchen to my bedroom every night.",4.0

You must ask Alexa to reconnect the Bluetooth after an inactivity period. 3.  Finally it does not have skills to connect to Hive home automation products if you live in the US. It seems like only the UK has this option. My comment 1. Is the most discouraging. This functionality seems to be a an obvious oversight. One last thought is the skills to Ale a interface.

I really wanted to like this product, and at $50 it should be a steal (I even bought multiple), but I've been extremely unimpressed.Technically it has a lot of potential functionality, but here are my problems with it:- It doesn't recognize my voice well. I've done the voice training exercise for it multiple times, and I do NOT have an unusual accent or speech pattern/difficulty. But very frequently it won't understand phrases that I know work. It's so frustrating that I feel I need to make an effort to speak loudly and clearly each and every time, but even that doesn't seem to help much.- Sometimes, especially when I haven't used it for a little while, it won't respond to my query at all except for lighting up the blue ring briefly. Just another instance where I have to repeat myself, often multiple times. I don't know if it's because it goes into some kind of sleep/low power mode, but it's annoying.- I didn't expect the speakers to be loud or to be worth playing music out of, but I wish the max volume for Alexa's voice was louder. I can understand it from across the room, but not all that comfortably. I don't get the impression it's meant to be communicated with from more than a handful of feet away. I have excellent hearing according to my ENT, though I'll concede it won't be a problem for everyone as preferred volumes are subjective. But having even slightly better speakers would increase the range of options for those that do want them.- In terms of the basic things it can respond to, Google Now is just lightyears ahead. I get relevant information from Google Now nearly the vast majority of times I use it for new questions/topics, but with the Echo I was shocked at how basic some of the questions were that Alexa hasn't been able to respond to. I find myself trying new queries less and less unless I've already made an effort to look them up in her skills menu and make sure they work.I'm sure Alexa's response will improve with time, but since I'm rating the product as it is, I can't recommend it. It's been less than a week and it's already feeling like more of a chore to use the device than a convenience. For example, it's easier and faster to pull out my phone and open the Nest app to change my thermostat's temperature than speaking the phrase to get Alexa to change it multiple times. Same thing with just about everything else I wanted to use the Echo with.All in all, it doesn't feel like it's been a beneficial addition to my home. I think the cheap price was enough to warrant the second star, but in its current form it would have to hit ~$35 for me to be comfortable rating it any higher. That might sound like a crazy price considering the last gen model was $100, but if I'm giving an honest opinion, it does feel like a $35 device - specifically, a $35 off-brand knockoff of what I actually expected the Echo Dot to be.",2.0

It won't recognize voice commands unless you're right next to it, and even then, it often doesn't comply with the commands. Setting it up was a pain - unlike the Echo, it did not find my 5G network, and when I finally did finish setting it up, it did something to the account so that the original Echo no longer recognized my Spotify account.

Kind of a waste here.My biggest issue is, if you want to listen to music, which is the Dot’s forte, you HAVE to pay for a Amazon Prime account. I am not going to do this.The gift I bought for my wife, an Echo Dot, is limited to answering questions that may or may not be in the Alexa database, and she is denied any ability to play music other than what she already paid for on Amazon. I wanted to keep my Amazon account separate from my wife’s, but due to that, she can’t get anything from Amazon, even though I bought this for her and set it up under her profile.So, the Dot is cool, but it is designed to make money for Amazon. (Duh) The problem is, if you buy one, and expect to get what is promised on the page, you also HAVE TO BUY a Prime account. So, Amazon pretends that there is no subscription fee for using a Dot, or any other Tap or Echo device, but bear in mind that it is not something worth buying if you are not the Prime Account Holder. It is so limited that it is worthless.Google does NOT require all of this paid membership stuff.",2.0

I purchased 3 for myself and as Christmas presents.  The technology offers a lot of promise and worked flawlessly the first several weeks, but become non-functional thereafter.

I'm checking to see if the units I gave as gifts are similarly affected.Even through the device does not work reliably, I still give it 2 stars because it holds a lot of potential.  It was excellent when it worked, and Amazon provides great developer support to creating/scripting new skills/apps.Unless there is a definitive fix, I suggest waiting a year or so until the bugs are sorted out.  In the meantime, I'll have to check out the other main voice assistance appliance which also has great developer support and application integration.UPDATE:  (-1 star) Amazon tech support for Alexa products informed me that the Dot should be within 12-15' (possibly upto 20') of the WiFi hub to work reliably.  I asked her to repeat this fact several times to make sure she was reading it correctly.  If this is true, there is no way these Dots can be placed throughout a house and all be within 12-15' of the WiFi hub.  It makes no sense that Dots are sold in packs of 3 or 6 for use throughout a house if the connection distance to each unit is so limited.

Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and the Echo Dot (2nd generation) is fantastic in its size and capability (I bought a six pack to get one free). There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Dot like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like ""Alexa volume 5""). The 2nd gen Echo Dot is also available in white but I'm sticking with black. UPDATE: I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same.Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say ""Alexa stop"" without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening.When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it ""thumbs up"" if I like the song or ""thumbs down"" if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down.Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is decent for voice. For music you'll want to connect it to a speaker system because the Dot's small internal speaker is weak. I do wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.Positives:* The new feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. I was also very happy to hear that the first generation Echoes will also support this in the next firmware update (I think devices are updating now). From my research, if the Echo app shows that you have a device software version greater than 4008 then you should have the update with ESP support. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.* It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Dot hears better during music playback but it's still not ""Star Trek quality"" hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.* It's relatively cheap and well worth the asking price.* It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack, which I use with two of my Dots to connect to the line-in on one of my computers and another to the line-in on an old compact stereo/CD player. Sound quality should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.* Some people complain of connection issues, but all of my Echoes stay connected without issue to my Asus RT-AC68U router.* If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia <subject>'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes.Negatives (mostly minor but take note):* Warranty is only 90 days. I think it should be 1 year. Of course they will sell you a SquareTrade 1, 2, or 3 year warranty for $5/year if you want. Perhaps another cost-cutting move.* The shiny (glossy) black surface can be a fingerprint magnet but you probably won't be touching it often. The previous generation wasn't glossy.* I had trouble configured my 2nd Echo Dot (the first one went fine). The Alexa app (on Android) gave me the cryptic message ""Authorization expired. Please reconnect your phone to the internet, log out from the app and retry"". Got it several times. I resolved it by signing out of the Alexa app and then signing back in, having to re-enter my email and password.... annoying... and I wonder why I didn't have this issue setting up my first Echo Dot just minutes prior???? Oh well. UPDATE: This just happened again on another day when setting up two more Echo Dots. This first Echo Dot setup went fine, but on the second one I got the ""Authorization expired."" message again. Beware of this issue if setting up more than one Echo Dot.* While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say ""Alexa play <song> from my library"".* This doesn't affect me, but the Echo does not support enterprise networks that require centralized network authentication with a login. Some might want to know this (like teachers who might want to use it in a school that uses this type of network authentication).* The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. For example, when launching it sometimes just sits there on the intro screen and spins forever until you shut down the app and restart it again.* Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.Home Automation:* I use several Belkin WeMo switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. Fortunately they work better now after all the firmware updates.* I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the ""Honeywell Total Connect Comfort"" skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1 and one Honeywell RTH6580WF.* I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say ""Alexa, turn on TiVo"" and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with ""Alexa turn off TiVo"". There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty ""cool"" even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).* I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (""if this then that"") recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to ""play"".Wishes:* High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is ""good enough"".* Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.* Weather alerts. I suggested this a long time ago and they still haven't added it... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.* Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a ""Ask My Buddy"" skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (""Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help"") and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.Compared to Google Home (which I just bought):* Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)* Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google ""How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville"" and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.* No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot* I prefer saying ""Alexa"" to ""OK Google"" as the wake word (UPDATE: ""Hey Google"" works now too!)* I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more ""intelligent"" than EchoOther:* It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal.* The USB power cable is about 5 feet.* The 1st gen Echo Dot was almost double the price. I feel a little disappointed that they now have a 2nd gen that is overall better for much less money... and that it came out very shortly after the 1st gen Echo Dots.* You don't need any other Echo units to use the Dot... some people might think you do but this is just like the ""big Echo"", only without the ""big"" sound. Instead a little speaker is included.* It's USB powered and comes with a USB power adapter and USB cable. NOTE: If you use a USB power connection other than from the included power adapter then there could be power and/or sound quality issues. I had some sound quality issues (background noises) and eliminated them by switching to the included USB power adapter.* About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like ""your Echo received an important update and must restart"". So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.* For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings->Voice Training.* I bought some of these powered bookshelf speakers, hooked them to the Echo Dot, and have been impressed with what you get for the money: Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf SpeakersWhile not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. Highly recommended, especially for the price. UPDATE: I'm reducing my rating from 4.5 to 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home.",4.0

Pre-ordered one and purchased another one to get decent coverage of our main floor in the house. We are very happy with these guys and had the right expectations. I saw complains of audio quality but I mean seriously??? People use your brains... if you want high quality audio you clearly need to spend a lot more money than $49 on a smart home device that has a speaker. It's perfect to have when we play sleep music for the kids at night and our own music in the kitchen-- perfect volume to only hear in those specific rooms. As always new technology isn't perfect so sometimes the various smart home skills don't work (Alexa says they are offline but for example she still turns on hue lights off even after say it's not available). We've had to unplug power on them a dozen times as for some reason it disconnects from our wireless and just had the red light.. again not a huge issue as it takes 5 seconds of effort to fix. Overall we think these devices understand things better than Siri and look forward to what it'll bring in the future.,5.0

Alexa isn't what I expected even though I now have two.  It isn't all that intelligent as you must remember key words to invoke any skill.  With 15000 skills and climbing that is impossible..  Alexa should be able to determine by what you are asking what skill would handle that.  To arms my alarm in the house I have to go through a miriad of crap when I could either pick up my celllphone and arm it a hundred times faster or walk over to the alarm and push the button.  Clearly GOOGLE is still the enemy and so they use BING but Alexa doesn't always give you an answer.  If I ask a question I can see it searched on bing by looking at the app but it never returned a verbal answer to me.  ""I don't that one"" or something similar comes up.  If I ask my GOOGLE on my phone the exact same question I get an answer each and every time.  Also I have had zero luck in my DOT creating a contact list of anyone who has the app or the appliance in their home so I can't call anyone.  GOOGLE calls anyone in the United States on their Device.  As far as skills go 90% of them are garbage skills and again to invoke them YOU must remember the keywords or forget it.  Not going to work.  Take example ambient room noise to sleep.  There must be ten different skills with ten different phrases to invoke the apps.  One would think I should be able to say, ""Alexa play ambient sleeping sounds"" and it should ask ""which type"".  If I say one that does not exist it could then ask me if I want a nature noise or animal noise etc. followed then by which in that genre it has.  Probably the easiest skill is my thermostat.  I can have Alexa change it with relative ease.  So you get the idea and last the wake word for the device.  They should let you add maybe two to three others.  I have a habit of calling it Alexis which wakes it up but then it doesn't respond and it takes me forever to realize I have not said Alexa.  And if you buy more than one you must change the wake word on each device individually.  Right now this is a toy.  Needs lots of work on their sever end to make it a truly useful product that can do almost whatever you ask.  There is no intelligent processing of your request going on here.  My advice is that its become so cheap why not buy it but don't expect much.  Apps on your cellphone right now work quicker and you can access much faster and you don't have to remember some keyword to get the app or skill to work.",2.0

In the meantime, Alexa is still saying she does not understand the question.I have Amazon Prime, so music is too limited, at least for the musicians and composers I have requested. These have ranged from classic rock to world music to new age to classical composers, including Handel, Mozart, Bach.  I would consider paying for unlimited, but Alexa is inconsistent in what she finds to play, and inconsistent in playing the music smoothly without long waits between my request and beginning to play, or between sections of music. Similarly, she may read to me an hour or more from a Kindle book, or she may behave as she is doing now, read a sentence or two or a few paragraphs, then pause some minutes and resume.

I've owned the full-sized Amazon Echo for about a year, and have been generally happy with the device, so decided I would give the new Echo Dot (2nd Generation) a try in my office.  Although I knew not to expect great sound quality from the small built-in speaker in the Echo Dot, I still found the sound quality and levels disappointing.  No problem though, I thought, as I have a Bose Soundlink Mini bluetooth speaker (the first generation Soundlink, as opposed to the Sounlink II) available to use with the Echo Dot.  I had no problems pairing the Soundlink with the Echo Dot, and was able to enjoy good sound quality from the Soundlink when paired with the Echo Dot for playing various Amazon Prime music stations.  However, I have since discovered a design flaw/oversight that dramatically decreases the usefulness of the Echo Dot for my arrangement.  If I ask Alexa to stop playing music (in order to take a call, for example), the bluetooth connection with the Soundlink will eventually time out because the Soundlink will power off if nothing is playing after a period of time (maybe 15-20 minutes).  When this happens, the Echo Dot automatically resumes playing music through its built-in speaker, even though my last command to the Echo Dot was to stop playing music about 15-20 minutes earlier.  This obviously is bothersome (and embarrassing) when I'm in the middle of a work call, and all of a sudden the Echo Dot starts playing music right next to me.  This also happens whenever I manually power off the Soundlink speaker while it's connected via bluetooth to the Echo Dot.  I can't understand why the Echo Dot would be programmed to restart playing music whenever an external bluetooth speaker connection is terminated, even though nothing is playing when the disconnection occurs.  Perhaps my Echo Dot is defective, but I suspect this is just a bad design flaw/oversight.  I've since decided to return the Echo Dot, and just purchase another full size Amazon Echo for use in my office, and skip the whole bluetooth speaker connection problem.",3.0

However, the Dot would not pair with the receiver.  The guy I talked with in tech support confirmed that they would not pair, and said Amazon should change the description to reflect that a device may support the A2DP profile but still not pair.  In order to pair my phone with my receiver, I had to enter a pass code into my phone.  The Dot does not have the capability to do that.  Bottom line is that the Dot doesn't pair with any of my devices.

I bought the original Amazon Echo at the beginning of this year. No problems with Wifi connection with my Uverse router/modem. However, recently I bought 3 Echo Dots 2nd generation.

Even though I have a Wifi extender and three arcs throughout the house on my cell phones, my Dot keeps repeating that it lost its connection. I have done hard reboots and relocated the units in different locations, still resulting in lost connections. This is very frustrating and time consuming every time I repeat the setup.

I'd heard of this but wasn't quite sure exactly what it did. I definitely didn't plan to buy one, but then one landed in my hands at work so I figured I'd give it a try. I do love gadgets. The setup was supposed to be dummy-proof, but it took all of the patience I had and some that I didn't to get it to stay connected to my wi-fi. Most annoying. Moving it higher and closer to my wifi repeater seemed to do the trick. I did not connect a speaker because the built in one sounded perfectly fine to me. It's a cute little device that takes up no space and has cool lights that tell you whether it's thinking or about to tell you it can't tell you. Anything. (I'm sorry, I didn't get that. [Repeat] )I wasn't wowed by the Alexa app, but it worked, after a fashion. Then I went to Amazon to figure out how to play music. I'm not a power music player, but something other than the radio in my den sometimes is nice. As I'd connected the Dot to my Prime account, I figured there would be at least some streaming option - they are always telling me it's there. And it is. There just isn't any music you would listen to without  strong restraints. (Alexa, play some Led Zepplin. [Cue a random terrible Led Zepplin tribute band,] Ah - nevermind,)I do buy Amazon music, and I actually like it, but that's on another account. However, I discovered you can also connect Spotify. I have a premium account, so I linked that - fairly easy - and -bam- I now have music. That was sweet. And while rooting around in the commands, I saw a vast number of interesting offerings. Some were half-baked, it is true, but I do think this thing has great potential. I added a few things and they show up on Alexa as activated.I've had this thing for a week and a half, so I can't say anything about it's durability, but the 3-month warranty sounds shady and I will update this review if there is breaking news (pun intended) on that front. In the meantime, I'm enjoying learning how to use and enjoy this device, I think we will see more of this type of device not in homes of the future but in homes of today. It's pretty nifty.

""Alexa, in thirty minutes, turn off the bedroom light""  ""Alexa, every night at 10pm, set volume to 3""These are such simple and common sense things that it is nearly unforgivable that they are not included.On the other hand it is cute that she will give me an interesting fact for the day if I tell her ""Good Morning"".

It responds when it wants to after being prompted with a question or statement and often times it says ""Sorry... I'm having trouble understanding right now.  Please try again a little later.""  Really?  Try again later?  I guess I paid for convenience with this product... but it's not always convenient for ""Alexa"" to be responsive.  I'm debating on a return of this item. I'm super underwhelmed by this product and would not recommend the current version.UPDATE 1/9/2016: The Echo Dot DOES NOT pair well via bluetooth to the Bose Soundlink Mini II wireless speaker (as advertised).

For example, it could not answer these questions: ""How old is the Irish language?"" or ""What is considered the most popular Christmas movie?"" or ""What are the most common names in Portugal?"" or ""What is the age of the oldest person alive?"" or ""What is the record high temperature for this day?"" etc. If you want the weather for Des Moines or the distance in miles from the earth to the moon or anything else that might be already listed on Wikipedia then Alexa will work for you.

The main problem with Alexa is that, unlike a human companion, Alexa does not seem to understand that humans are creatures with habits.  Thus, every morning at 6 AM, I have to say ""Alexa: play WAMU from TuneIn"".  If I forget the ""from TuneIn"", she plays a random pop station from iHeart radio (and I never listen to pop radio).  And of course, I can just forget saying ""Alexa: WAMU"".  I am so sick of saying this.I especially dislike the routine I have to go through to get her to play the book I am currently listening to on Audible.  If I just say ""Alexa, play Swann's way from audible"" she will claim I do not have the book, even though looking at what she puts on the app regarding what she heard, she clearly correctly transcribed what I said.  So, to get her to play my book, I have to first ask her what books I have on audible, then ask her if I have Swann's Way on audible.  Then, if I ask her to play Swann's Way on audible, she plays it.  Now, Swann's Way is a very long book, so we have been going through this routine every time I want to listen for many months now.  She seems to have no idea that the book I am currently reading on audible is Swann's Way.  This would be a very easy thing to code; I do not know why the Alexa authors have not done this.If you send a mail to customer help about this, you will get a long obsequious response, like the one Eric Idle does when playing a waiter who has received a complaint about a dirty spoon, in Monte Python, and then a pointer to a completely irrelevant long document.

Gave the Echo Dot a try for a week. Too inconsistent and not worth buying unless you're going to make a concerted set of purchases surrounding it.The consistency part may have been a hardware problem; in the course of one week, the Dot completely reset itself on its own and had to be re-started from the beginning 3 separate times. On several other occasions, it just bricked and didn't turn on at all until it was unplugged and then re-plugged. Since you can't tell on the outside if the Dot's working or not, it was rather frustrating and following the on-line instructions to reset it didn't help at all.The other major issue is that the Dot just isn't that useful unless you also want to buy a lot of other things like Amazon Unlimited or Spotify. It's surprisingly lacking in basic things via voice like being able to search for new podcasts. If I'm going to have to use the Alexa App anyways, I might as well just use a podcast app in my phone. The lack of flexibility was also an issue with Google Calendar and the To-Do list, though those worked fairly well when just trying to add or review things.Overall it was frustrating from a technical standpoint and somewhat disappointing from a utility standpoint.

Electronic design and circuitry may be the same, but due to the physical size, it seems to operate slightly different.  Microphone sensitivity seems lower, and you have to speak louder than your normal voice when directing commands.  Obviously speaker quality is a bit muffled.  It is an excellent choice if you do not want to spend the money for the full sized echo.  I am using this unit in my bedroom as an extension of a regular echo.

Product OverviewI purchased an echo dot last christmas for my parents to try out. They enjoy using voice commands with their phones, so I figured they would like to have this in the house to help them out as well. While I see that it has capabilities beyond answering simple questions and performing simple tasks, I don't see my parents using it as much more than that. I believe the ideal user of this product would be younger people and new homeowners. I say this because they would be more likely to use all the capabilities that the echo dot provides, such as smart home devices. I based my review off of simple guidelines such as voice recognition, capabilities, price, and usefulness.Voice RecognitionThe voice recognition is unmatched. I can yell from another room over and it will understand me. They tout this by talking about the 7 microphones that are in the device.CapabilitiesThe capabilities of this device are far above what most people would be able to use, which makes it a great product for a diverse group of people. The echo has the ability to do many things, but I think some of this technology is ahead of what the common consumer will use in this day and age. Yes, people have smart homes but that isn't the vast majority of people and it definitely isn't me or my parents. In my mind this is similar a stay at home “Siri"" for most. It can perform simple tasks with wifi connection but turning on lights, changing the channel on your tv or opening your garage door requires more purchases and more headache.PricePrice is very cheap for the quality of product you receive. That is the reason I purchased it, it was cheap enough that I felt comfortable trying it.SummaryThe reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is the amount of time it takes to setup all the capabilities and the other accessories you need to buy like smart home devices in order for it to work. Other than that I believe a common customer such as yourself would be happy with this purchase.",4.0

Honestly, this is my first ""Smart"" device like this, and i'm very mixed.I have friends that have the Amazon Echo (traditional, not dot) and they like it very much. It's always on-key when you're telling it to play songs, reliably plays songs when requested, and doesn't have connection issues.However, my dot has not been so complication free. It often misunderstands commands, thinks that we're talking to it when we're not, and loses the WiFi connection without reason. Not only that, but it doesn't understand many commands you try and tell it to do (with Bing being one of the worst features of the device). For comparison purposes, I attempted to use the Google Home and it was much more fluid with responses. The most common thing I hear is the Dot telling me it doesn't understand the question it was asked. Asking some questions also results in totally unwarranted responses. If I ask a dumb question like the forecast in two weeks, it replies with the next 7 days. If I ask to play a song without an artist, it often picks the wrong song.I like the dot, I like it very much. But it's a flawed product with Bing behind it, and the microphones are either poorly designed or the software is very badly tuned to think many words are the same as ""Alexa"".I've tried changing the call-word, resetting the device, re-sycing the WiFi, reconnecting Spotify, and tuning it to my voice to no avail.",3.0

I really want to like the Dot. I got it on Black Friday so at the price I couldn't resist. I did not get it to control smart switches or the temperature or anything like that. I got it mostly because my parents have the original Echo and this seems like the same thing in a smaller form. A few of my opinions and reactions to other reviews:- I am not sure why there are so many complaints about the speaker volume in this?? I have it in my living room and no matter where I am in the room I can hear Alexa just fine. In fact, most times I don't have the volume set above level 5. I don't know what others are doing that they say it is hard to hear, but for me I have zero issue with that!!- I knew it was small, but this thing is like the size of a coaster. I find that to be a plus because it can go basically anywhere and not even be seen if you prefer.- Set up and syncing with Wi-Fi was incredibly simple and I have had no issue since then.- I am slightly disappointed at what appears to be limitations on the Dot's vocabulary or word recognition. Alexa far too often confuses what I say, or is unable to provide answers to questions that should be easy to answer- The Alexa skills through the Alexa app are nice ways to add capabilities to your Dot, but I don't like how you then have to remember a different phrase for each individual skill you have enabled. I wish that enabling a skill became part of the Dot's natural interaction instead of having to identify it by stating the skill you want it to do.- Alexa is very useful in many ways. She is very good at math which my daughter found out doing her homework one day. Being able to call for an Uber or look things up on Wikipedia is fantastic. Getting the daily news in the morning, playing some Jeopardy, hearing the weather, or setting an alarm is great as well. I really like adding things to my to-do list. What is interesting is that Alexa's vocabulary does not seem stifled for this task as she will add verbatim whatever you say.- Alexa only Prime deals is another added benefit, although I have yet to actually find a deal I want to take advantage of I know that there have been some in the past that were truly great deals and only available with an Alexa enabled device.The final thing I will say is that I am glad that there is the ability to change the ""wake word"" from Alexa. For a few days I could not understand why it seemed like Alexa was talking when I would speak to my daughter. It finally dawned on me that when I would say my daughter's name, Alyssa, sometimes Alexa would interpret that as me saying Alexa!! She would also respond at times if the TV commercial for the Dot came on so just an fyi that her hearing can be sensitive!! Overall I think this is a fun gadget to have. I hope that it will continue to evolve in it's capabilities and that eventually it will do many more things without having to search for a specific skill to add to enable it to do things.",4.0

I had high hopes for this Dot, but I am tired of hearing Alexa tell me she can't find the answer to my question, or she doesn't remember her last task and I have to start over. The Dot pairs well with some of our IoT devices, but many more of our IoT owned devices do not work. Luckily, Google Home is releasing in November and is powered by the most advanced search engine to date. Amazon Dot uses Bing and to date, I have never met an avg person, or even an IT person not working at Microsoft whom uses Bing to search. It would be nice if the Amazon Dot allowed us to use Google over Bing, but not doing so is the biggest deal breaker for me. Alexa is not smart at all using Bing and she can't remember questions or answer complex questions. However, she does only cost 50, but I would pay more to have the ability to use Google and a personal assistant that can answer complex questions or remember what I said. This brings me to why I am sending this back and paying almost 100 more for Google Home. We get what we pay for in Tech and now I see why this was so cheap. Google Weave is coming shortly after the release of Google Home, so we will also have a better environment for all of our IoT connected devices to run.",2.0

I am glad that I give it a try. I bought this device and want to try out.  There are several kinds on the market - Google Home, Echo and the upcoming Apple Hoe Pod.  I guess they are all similar but not the same.  Since I am new to this, I don't think I want to pay $100+ for an expensive speaker.  I just want one at my room.  Echo Dot is the right one for me and the price is the good fit.  It's quite affordable.I have seen both color in person at the mall. I think they have both pro and cons.  Black color is certain easy to blend in the any place.  But the dust is more visible.  I end up bought the white color.  I find this looks better.  The device is well made and pretty solid.I don't have much expectation of this devices.  But I realized that there are skills that you are added to it.  I have added several of them.  So far I like it. So far, I use it on listen news notification, weather, alarm, and the new briefing.  Using Alexa to ask question is okay.  But I have no tried enough.  I think Google Assistant is doing a better job.  I think I am going to add my iPhone Calendar to it soon.  Then I want to use it to control light.For $39, it's a good entry price to try this kind of device.  If you want a better sound while playing music, you could buy a better Bluetooth speaker or connect to your home audio system.I hope Amazon can allow Echo to play news notification (e.g Breaking News, Weather Alert, and etc) automatically.

I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like ""play the new album by ___""  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say ""play the program ___"".  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device.",2.0

I actually had the echo pick up a command (in the next room correctly) when the dot did not.  The dot also appears to have a modest connection issue and will acknowledge that it's lost it's network connection slightly more often then the echo even though the dot is in the same room as my network booster and the echo is one room further.  But, positives are that it's both significantly smaller and can be placed in locations where the echo would just be either too large or intrusive.

Now, stand bewildered when it tells you that your schedule is empty.The Spotify integration was cool at first but I quickly grew tired of the app playing the wrong artist or track.In all, I used the device for a few weeks and it has sat unplugged since then.",2.0

So far I am a bit disappointed at the echo dot. As a person with accent it doesn't always understand me.

Full disclosure...the home that we purchased about a year ago had already-installed high-quality ceiling speakers in every room and outside speakers for a porch and two outside decks. We play music through Sonos. From what I understand, the Dot does not communicate with Sonos. I knew that going in, I would not use the Dot to play music. So the Dot has other cute things like adding items to a grocery list and setting a timer, both conveniences to have for an avid cook. OK. I did some exploring and found that I could add my address to Alexa to get tide information and weather. Well, not Alexa's fault but the tide skill provides information for Boston, while I am on Cape Cod. Close, but no cigar. Skill developers could certainly grab tide data for my location since I already access it on my iPhone, but they do not. This lack of granular detail renders the Dot useless. It tells me jokes. Meh.

Ended up unplugging it and walk away. Most likely will return it and ask for another one.I seriously question about the quality control that Amazon puts into their product. This is not the first time I bought an Amazon product. I bought a Kindle few years ago and it broke on the thirteenth month after using it. Since the product only has 1year warranty in it, I wasn't able to return or exchange it.  So my lesson from all these is, ""If you still like Amazon's product/technology then make sure you buy their insurance."" GRRRRR........",2.0

My life has changed.It happened on Father’s Day, when my oldest daughter gave me an Amazon Echo Dot.How could something that looks like a Japanese anime version of a hockey puck change your life?Just a minute ago (it’s Sunday night, right after the White Walkers’ bloe-eyed dragon burned down the wall on Game of Thrones), I wondered what the weather would be like tomorrow.Did I look it up in the Sunday paper?No. It’s in a pile in the kitchen.Did I check on my phone?No. Too many swipes and taps.Did I sit down to my computer and check the forecast on Weather Underground?No. That meant walking all the way across the house.Instead, I went into our upstairs kitchen.“Alexa,” I said, “what’s the weather tomorrow?”Without pause, Alexa told me.I could have asked her to play a song about the weather.She would have.I could have asked her what happened in history that day.Alexa would have known.I could have asked her who her favorite Game of Thrones character is. (It’s Daenerys Targaryen, by the way…mother of dragons – I did ask).I could have asked Alexa to play thunderstorm sounds.She would have.Alexa is also able to turn lights off and assemble a to-do list and if she can tap something on the internet – and she’s awfully good at it – she will.My wife and I regularly ask Alexa about the weather. Our little Echo Dot is on a side table and we walk through the kitchen, ask our question, get out answer, and move on. It’s uncanny and surprising and oh, so nice.As much as my wife and I see Alexa as a tool, an assistant, our grandkids discovered a new friend with limitless possibilities for fun. They asked for Pokemon music and got it. We left them alone with Alexa for an hour, and Alexa entertained as they stretched her ability to keep 11- and 12-year-olds occupied…or maybe they didn’t stretch her ability.Having a down moment in the day, Alexa will tell you a joke.“What did the father buffalo say when he took his junior buffalo to college?” Alexa asks.Then she answers before you can say, “What?”“Bye, son,” she says.In 2013, a movie starring Joaquin Phoenix, Her, caused a bit of a sensation with its plot of a lonely writer falling in love with a computer operating system.Alexa is so disarmingly friendly and helpful, it makes you take a step back and wonder, if artificial intelligence were more robust and built into a system like the Echo Dot, would more of us fall in love with – and be eventually dominated by – our little machines? Humans do grow attached to things…like smartphones.But for now, we’re loving Alexa.As long as she doesn’t tell me to take out the garbage.",5.0

The Echo Dot is the most affordable and easiest way to own a part of Amazon's best tech right now. It's usually priced around $50, but if you wait for those seasonal sales, you can get it as low as $39.The Echo Dot is pretty simple to set up, although it may take a couple of tries. You need a phone or a tablet that can house the Alexa App. This app will have your Wi-Fi info, your personal info and your general location. While the Alexa app is critical for set up, it is not necessary for the everyday functionality, for instance if you placed it on your phone, and then your phone battery died, the Echo Dot is still functioning as long as your Wi-Fi is still up and running.I feel that people expect too much from the Echo Dot. They treat it like it's already the Star Trek computer, but think of it more like a tablet or your cell phone. Without any apps, you can get the weather, the time, perhaps contact somebody and not much else. It's the applications that we add that give us our gadgets the use we love to use everyday. While Echo also has the functionality to shop on Amazon.com by simply giving commands is also built in, yet if you want stuff like games and music you're going to need to add some apps.I like playing Jeopardy with my Echo Dot. With this app you get a new set of questions every day, and the Dot will keep your running tallies. Playing music is also pretty important to have as a function. While Amazon would suggest you get Amazon Music Unlimited, I prefer to spend my money on Spotify for my one premium music app. So now when I want to hear Strawberry Fields Forever, I don't say, ""Alexa play me Strawberry Fields Forever,"" I command, ""Alexa play me Strawberry Fields Forever on Spotify.""  Now that I have connected Spotify in my Alexa app, I just need to say those two extra words 'on Spotify' and I can hear virtually any song I desire. ""Alexa play me the News of the World album by Queen on Spotify"" I listen to the whole album. She shuffles my playlists if I ask as well.As a Prime customer I also uploaded a bunch of my CDs that aren't on any music service. I have for instance Law and Order: Guilty of Innocence, a favorite album of mine from the early 1990s. So here I don't have to say ""on Spotify"" but just ""Alexa play the album Guilty of Innocence by Law and Order"" and she will usually. If I mis-step and say it incorrectly, she will play me some hip-hop garbage despite the fact that Law and Order is a metal/grunge band. We have to remember that The Echo Dot is not smart, and cannot learn things from our habits, she just listens and she tries to comply with how she was programmed to do.One thing that bothers me is that Alexa cannot answer questions about herself.  ""Alexa when was your last firmware update?"" She'll reply, ""Sorry, I don't know that."" Alexa how loud can your speaker go? - ""Sorry..."", Alexa, what are you made of? - ""Sorry....Also, you really need perfect American diction.  My Puerto Rican friend just got one, and he has a thick accent despite being born in the Bronx (yeah I know, don't get me started), and he'll say ""Echo (he chose to call her Echo), playee Si-leent Night"" and then she'll give him the news. SO he calls me and I give his Echo the command and then she'll play Silent Night. Also, don't stutter because Alexa has no tolerance for this either. ""Alexa play me the um, uh..""  She'll come back with ""Here's a station I think you'd enjoy"" before you can finish your thought. And then she'll play a Hip-Hop station complete with B-words and the N word spoken a hundred times before you can yell, Alexa NO. Why would she think I would like a hip-hop station, all I play is Classic Rock, Country and Avril Lavigne. But then I remember, she can't learn from my listening history. Yet why is she programmed to play this offensive music whenever she gets the chance?  Amazon have their sneaky ways and reasoning I'm sure.Also, you can't ask her opinion questions - ""Alexa, what is better Burger King or McDonalds?"" You will just get, ""Sorry I don't know that one"".I still love the Echo Dot, and I feel that the tech is only going to get better. I'm glad she is with me and my family, she keeps us smiling all day while we are around her.",5.0

If you ask trivia or want to know the hours of a local business, it works great, but I find it doesn't work great finding the music I like, even Amazon Music. I like classical and Alexa wants to play the same classical playlist over and over even when I request a different (specific) playlist.  If I like a song and want to hear more like it, it doesn't understand. It doesn't work like pandora.  You need to tell it very specifically what to play, and even then it misunderstands and plays something obnoxious that is not even in the same music genre.  I enjoy the suggested music and serendipity offered by some of the other music services that seem to understand my preferences.  It is a great alarm clock though!",3.0

I mean, it's great for asking about weather (temperature), sports, news, playing some music, setting timers and alarms, some calculations and conversions, and some of the skills are great, but it's just not very intuitive:1. When I ask about weather, it'll tell me the temperature and if it's sunny / rainy / whatever. If I say ""Weather in Celsius"" (I use Fahrenheit) or ""Humidity,"" it treats what I say like I just asked about the weather.2. ""Wake me up in 15 minutes"" makes it set a 15 minute timer instead of setting an alarm 15 minutes after I asked for an alarm to be set. Timers aren't as loud as alarms, so it's not a good thing to wake up with. It's a little nitpicky, but my phone can do it, so I've just been using my phone instead.3. Sometimes it's a little hard of hearing. I'll say ""Alexa, weather"" and it'll light up when I call her, but will just ignore whatever I say after. This has happened when I was a little farther away from it (around 3 feet, but with nothing else making noise in my room), and it has happened when I was less than a foot away from it (it's on my desk, and it sometimes can't hear me when I'm actually sitting on my desk).There's also sometimes a disconnect with regards to how she thinks I talk, which is weird since I don't really have any distinct accent, so I sometimes have to try out different pronunciations to see what she understands, and those don't work all the time either. It's a frustration of mine if I want her to play something from Spotify, but names in general are weird so I'll let that slide4. Sometimes I'll ask something, then I'll ask a follow-up question right after it and she just doesn't connect the dots:""Who played Belle in the Beauty and the Beast Movie?""""In Beauty and the Beast, Belle was played by Emma Watson""""What are her other movies""""Hmm, I can't find an answer to the question I've heard""""What are Emma Watson's other movies""""Here are a few movies playing near you today...""??????Also:""Play Art Angels on Spotify""""Playing Art Angels by Grimes on Spotify""""Play more songs by Grimes / Play similar songs""""Artangels by Grimes""""Play a different album""""Sorry, I didn't get that"" (I've said it different ways and she still gives me this answer.""Play a different album by this artist""""Here's an album you might like: The Black Parade by My Chemical Romance""??????It's a little frustrating, but at least I know what I can and can't ask her. I'd probably still buy this regardless since I extensively use some of her features and she's still pretty convenient to use when I'm too lazy to fumble through my phone and look at the weather report for the day or the week / set a timer (for tea / ramen) / get scores for sports so I can basically sympathize / celebrate with the people in my life who watch sports / make to-do lists as i think about it / play music / listen to audiobooks.",3.0

It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.

I ordered the Echo Dot just a few days after purchasing a Google Home.  My thoughts were to compare, test and decide which one I liked the best and best suited my desires.  I love listening to music and what I found with both devices was that they ultimately stop providing access to their music libraries.  Had I known access to the music libraries would have such a limited availability prior to spending my money, I never would have ordered them.  Both the Google Home and Amazon Dot are essentially useless for my needs now.  Yes, they do answer certain types of questions, as designed, and I suppose it will still allow one to use the remote activation services if one wants to automate such devices in their homes.  However, for my purposes, access to the ""free"" pre-recorded music has been terminated thus rendering both devices useless and worthless as far as I'm concerned.  While the Google Home does allow linking to a number of paid streaming services, the Amazon Dot is much more limited.

It is fun to play around with. However, I didn't know that it had to stay plugged in, therefore making it less mobile. Also, the only item in my house that I could have controlled through Alexa, my doorbell through ring.com, isn't supported. Doesn't seem like it is really worth the money just to ask it about the weather.",3.0

I am on my 25th day as an Echo owner, and I'm sending it back.  It was fun for the first 2 days, asking Alexa stupid questions and getting quirky replies. Beyond that, it is useless . Ask a specific question, or about current topics, and she will tell you, ""I'm not sure about that."" Ask her to play music, and she might... or she might play a sample, and solicit your monetary participation.  I have Prime, and it still wants me to buy other subscriptions.  Not a good value.

Received a Dot as a gift. Aside from the fact that it looks like an ugly hockey puck, it's mostly useless to me. It doesn't work with Google Play Music or Youtube music. It works with my Prime music but the catalog isn't anywhere near what Google offers. It also doesn't work with Chromecast/Netflix. Other than that, it's horrible at answering questions. It doesn't even perform simple web searches. I asked alexa to recommend nearby restaurants and it said it didn't have that ability yet. I asked it for directions to a nearby business and it couldn't answer.I give it credit that the voice recognition works well, setup was simple and it connected easily to my bluetooth speaker but overall this feels like a half finished product. It falls far short of my expectations. I think I will return it and check back in a year or two after the service matures",2.0

I seriously love everything I can do with Alexa. I have a rather busy life and I can get every update on weather or news all by asking Alexa as I'm getting ready and it connects to my phone quickly to play my music. Setting alarms also has never been easier in my life. I would recommend this product to quite honestly everyone it's an amazing device!,5.0

OK, maybe Alexa deserves a better rating given she does what she is advertised to do. But after having her in the house for a month, I found the Echo Dot was only being used for novelty purposes or responding to false positives. At the price point, it seemed like a good opportunity to try out a home assistant, but it wasn't something we used on a daily basis. In hindsight, it seems pointless to use in conjunction with a smart phone. I have a Nexus with Google Assistant which does everything the Echo was doing for me and usually does it better. Plus the phone is almost always with me rather than isolated in one room of the house. ""OK Google..."" works with my IoT switches and outlets, news briefings, weather updates, online information and adding items to my shopping list. Aside from novelty, I see no point is buying into another eco-system unless you really like instant ordering from Amazon.",2.0
